# GDM Configuration file.
#
# You should not update this file by hand.  Since GDM 2.13.0.4, configuration
# choices in the gdm.conf-custom file will override the default values
# specified in this file.  This file may be overwritten on upgrade, so to
# ensure that your configuration choices are not lost, please make sure that
# your modifications are only made to the gdm.conf-custom file.  If you were
# using a previous version of GDM and had made changes to your gdm.conf file,
# this file should have been automatically renamed as gdm.conf-custom to ensure
# that your previous modifications are preserved.
#
# You can use the gdmsetup program to graphically edit the gdm.conf-custom
# file.  Note that gdmsetup does not support every option in this file, just
# the ones that most users want to change.  If you feel that gdmsetup should
# support additional configuratio options, please file a bug report at
# http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.
#
# If you hand-edit the GDM configuration, you should run the following command
# to get the GDM daemon to recognize the change.  Any running GDM GUI programs
# will also be notified to update with the new configuration.
#
# gdmflexiserver --command="UPDATE_CONFIG <configuration key>"
#
# For example, the "Enable" key in the "[debug]" section would be specified by
# "debug/Enable".
#
# You can also run gdm-restart or gdm-safe-restart to cause GDM to restart and
# re-read the new configuration settings.  You can also restart GDM by sending
# a HUP or USR1 signal to the daemon.  HUP behaves like gdm-restart and causes
# any user session started by GDM to exit immediately while USR1 behaves like
# gdm-safe-restart and will wait until all users log out before restarting GDM.
