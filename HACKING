This package mostly runs as root and is thus security prone, so be careful
about changes.  Ask me (jirka@5z.com) or Lee (lee0@callnetuk.com) if you have
questions.  It's probably better to ask before committing though we won't gnaw
your head off if you don't (unless you break something in which case we'll
get medieval on your ass:).  However we're never opposed to people hacking
on this and fixing things and adding features.  So have fun.
