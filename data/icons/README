                   GNOME DISPLAY MANAGER ICONS

This directory stores named (or themeable) icons for GDM designed to use the 
Tango style for appearance and Icon Naming Spec for names.

By now the following icons are included:
 
  | Icon Name           | Context      | Role                         |
  |---------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
  | gdmsetup            | apps         | Window and launcher icon     |
  |                     |              | for gdmsetup                 |
  |                     |              | (Login Window) application   |
  |---------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
  | gdmflexiserver      | apps         | Launcher icon for            |
  |                     |              | gdmflexiserver (New Login)   |
  |                     |              | application                  |

The installed icons are available in following formats/sizes:
  PNG - 16 x 16 pixels
  PNG - 22 x 22 pixels
  SNG - 32 x 32 pixels
  SVG - 48 x 48 pixels (canvas size and unit)

Those additional sizes/formats are also available
  * PNG 24x24 pixels --> generated from 22x22 addind 1 pixel transparent border
                         (see tango.freedesktop.org for details)
  * PNG 48x48 pixels --> generated from SVG, useful if the system needs to
                         draw the icon at this exact size without rendering the
                         svg one.

When relevant, source files (GIMP's XCF or SVG) are available for future changes
or other needs like derivative icons. Those files have the same name of the
final icon, but of course different extension (for example, in 32x32/apps
directory you have gdmsetup.png file, the installed one, and gdmsetup.svg file,
the source one, used to generate the first and useful for future changes).

If you need to provide a new named icon, you have to:
  * draw it at different sizes or search for a good artist
  * place them in proper directory, based on size and role. Note that only
    applications with "apps" context can be installed under "hicolor" theme.
    See http://live.gnome.org/ThemableAppSpecificIcons for details
  * include new icons to build, editing Makefile.am as follow:
     - add the icon to install to "icons_DATA" value in Makefile.am
     - add the source image, if any, to "noinst_DATA" value in Makefile.am
     - repeat for each size
  * if ensure, ask on gnome-themes-list@gnome.org
