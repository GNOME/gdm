Reporting Bugs:

  Please submit bug reports, enhancement requests, and patches to
  the "gdm" category at:

     http://bugzilla.gnome.org/

  When reporting bugs you should first turn on debugging on the
  "Security" tab of gdmsetup or editing gdm.conf-custom as
  described in the documentation.  This causes debug messages to
  be sent to the system log (/var/log/messages or /var/adm/messages)
  and include the GDM output sent to syslog.

  You should not have to configure syslog for this to work, but if
  you do not see GDM messages in your syslog it may require
  configuration.

  You should not leave "debug" on after collecting data.  It will
  clutter your syslog and slow system performance.

Installation:

  Please consult README.install for instructions on how to
  configure and install GDM.

Note:

Originally I started maintaining gdm2 because Martin didn't yet finish gdm3 and
was in general busy and we needed a working GDM for 1.4.  The move to gdm3 is
very unlikely to happen now that gdm3 has been pretty dead for quite
a while.
