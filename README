Note:

Originally I started maintaing gdm2 because martin didn't yet finish gdm3 and
was in general busy and we needed a working gdm for 1.4.  The move to gdm3 is
very unlikely to happen nowdays and gdm2 as gdm3 has been pretty dead for quite
a while.  Do not send gdm2 patches to martin (well you can but he'll likely
ignore them:), send them to me instead and I'll integrate them for you.
