===============
Version 2.31.1 
===============

- Now GDM saves its GConf settings per-seat.  This fixes bug #594818.  So now
  if the user launches or exits an AT program it only affects the display where
  the request was made, not all displays running the GDM dialog.
- Enable FD_CLOEXEC for signal self-pipe.  Fixes bug #617661.
- Improvements so compiling with -DGSEAL_ENABLE works better.
- Use g_remove() to remove directories instead of g_unlink().
- No longer clear the entry field by setting it to a list of '\b' characters.
  Now use gtk_editable_delete_text which safely clears the entry field instead.
  See bug #576801.
- Fix setting of WINDOWPATH so it does not assume the format is 32 bit.  Fixes
  bug #609272.
- Fix bug #591937 so the code compiles when ENODATA is not available.

===============
Version 2.31.0 
===============

- GDM now better compiles with -DGSEAL_ENABLED.  Fixes bug #612472.
- Tweak power manager policy to shutdown immediately when hitting power.
  Previously it would show a dialog with a 60 second timeout.  Fixes bug
  #617317.
- Sort session using file basename.  Fixes bug #617516.
- Avoid double conversion to utf8 in keyboard layout descriptions.  Fixes bug
  #617108.
- Fix build failure when libxdmcp is not available.  Fixes bug #616984.
- String fixes.  Fix bug #609178.

===============
Version 2.30.1 
===============

- Accessibility is now enabled by default for the GDM login screen.
- When the face browser is disabled, the PAM conversation is started
  immediately, so users do not need to click a button to start entering the
  username and password.  Fixes bug #591082.
- Add label-for and labelled-by a11y relations to the entry field in the
  login GUI.  This makes the login GUI more accessible when using AT programs.
  Fixes bug #613434.
- Fixed bugs that were causing XDMCP to not show the greeter again after
  logout.  Fixes bug #606724.
- The default XDMCP PingIntervalSeconds was increased from 15 to
  60 seconds.
- The WINDOWPATH environment variable is now set for the user session.  Fixes
  bug #609272.
- Ensure Init script is called when using Automatic Login.  Fixes bug #614488.
- Fix race condition with Timed Login.  Fixes bug #614062.
- Drop xhost localuser:gdm and localuser:root when the user session starts.
  Fixes bug #605350.
- Removed the icon monitor from the GDM login GUI since it was not functional
  and was causing problems with automounting user's $HOME directories.  Fixes
  bug #609321.
- Do not mark "%x" for translation.  Fixes bug #613306.
- Remove duplicated strings for translation.  Fixes bug #609179.
- Minor doc corrections.
- Translation updates.

===============
Version 2.30.0 
===============

- Translation improvements.

===============
Version 2.29.92
===============

- The greeter is not torn down until pam_open_session finishes since
  some PAM modules can ask questions up until this point.
- The daemon now kills the session process rather than the entire process
  group, fixing bug #607738.  The corresponding gnome-session bug #607658 
  is released with 2.29.92 so this works properly.

===============
Version 2.29.6
===============

- Various build fixes
- Crash fix in layout detection
- Crash fix in session list detection
- Remove timeout for interacting with PAM
- Fix compile with --no-as-needed
- Add debug message if system lacks fonts
- Disable switch user item if user switching won't work

===============

- Fix option widgets to work better with orca
- make --with-custom-conf work
- Don't hard code path to policykit agent
- Don't backup xkb configuration before login

===============
Version 2.29.1
===============

- A new desktop extension is now supported in GDM session desktop files
  (normally found in /usr/share/xsessions). Setting the key to true as follows:

  X-GDM_BypassXsession=true

  will cause the Xsession script to not be used to launch the session.  This
  can be useful if you want to create a "failsafe" xterm session.  The Xsession
  script sources the user's $HOME/.profile, for example, so setting this key
  to true will ensure that any errors in the user's $HOME/.profile will not
  cause the session to fail to start.

- Fix makedist problem.

===============
Version 2.29.0
===============

- Now GDM supports Include, Exclude, and IncludeAll configuration options to
  allow the ability to configure which users are displayed in the FaceBrowser.
- Now GDM supports better debugging.  Users can set the debug/Enable
  configuration option to turn on GDM debugging.
- The directory where GDM screenshots are placed has been moved to its own
  directory: /var/run/gdm/greeter/GDM-Screenshot.png.  The screenshot directory
  can now be specified at build time via the --with-screenshot-dir configure
  argument.
- Many simple-greeter Face Browser usability improvements.
- The simple-greeter Face Browser tree view search entry is now obscured to
  help prevent accidental display of passwords.
- Shutdown and reboot functions are moved to a menu in the simple-greeter panel
  instead of being presented as buttons.  The shutdown menu is better
  positioned on multi-monitor displays.
- The simple-greeter panel notification area has been improved and now honors
  the GConf setting for /apps/notification_area_applet/prefs/padding.
- The entry field in the simple-greeter now has accessibility labels so it will
  work better with accessibility programs.
- The clock in the simple-greeter panel no longer shows the date, making the
  screen look a little cleaner.  The date is moved to the clock tooltip so it
  is still available.
- The simple-greeter now uses gethostname instead of g_get_host_name since
  is more reliable when the hostname changes at runtime.
- The user switch applet now honors disable_lock_screen.  The option to lock
  screen is now not shown if disable_lock_screen is set.
- The /var/run/gdm directory is better locked down.
- GDM no longer crashes on bad UTF-8 in the /etc/passwd file.
- When the worker dies, the auth-failed signal is no longer sent.  This 
  prevents a crash that happens when switching run-levels when the login screen
  is displayed.
- Ensure that the length of sockaddr structure is set to the correct length for
  IPv4 or IPv6.  This makes GDM work better on some operating systems that are
  picky about the length being exact.
- String and documentation improvements.

===============
Version 2.28.1
===============

- GDM will now avoid calling XAddHosts for remote connections.  Refer to bug
  #598142 for more information.
- Now GDM uses DeviceKit-power instead of gnome-power-manager for Suspend
  support.
- Now the at-spi-registryd-wrapper.desktop GDM autostart file will run
  at-spi-registryd directly instead of calling at-spi-registryd-wrapper.
- Fix to the visibility check for the "Other" button which corrects some
  situations where the button would not appear when it was supposed to.
- Now the GDM daemon will make the /var/log/gdm directory if it does not exist.
- Fixes to avoid autologin failure when a NULL username is passed in.
- Restore CTYPE when canonicalizing codesets.
- Several fixes to avoid warnings.

===============
Version 2.28.0
===============

- Now GDM supports the ability to specify the automatic/timed login user via a
  script via the same interface that the old GDM supported.
- Now the user's dmrc and face image files are stored in /var/cache/gdm, so 
  that the login process does not need to access the user's $HOME directory 
  before authentication.  Refer to bug #565151.
- Fix the login GUI options widget so the language/session/layout choices are
  not reset after a failed login.
- Fix language dialog so it does not crash if the user click's the "OK" button
  when no language is selected.
- Fix to ensure that the login dialog regains focus after the language or
  layout dialogs are used.
- The language dialog has improved logic to sort the language names more
  correctly.
- Make sure to check error variable is not NULL before referencing it in the
  gdm-user-manager code.
- Make sure to not print NULL strings since this causes crashes on some
  platforms.
