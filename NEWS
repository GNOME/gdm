49.1
==========

* Translation updates
* Hotfixed a bug that leaves gnome-shell in a locked up state
* Fixed implementation of userdb, so we don't list our users when asked about
  UID 0 (root)
* Switched safety check that avoids accidentally deleting / and /home from an
  assertion to an error, so the check always runs even in production builds
* Fixed bug where gnome-initial-setup's configuration (i.e. input methods)
  failed to migrate to the final user session
* Fixed bug where GDM assumed that Wayland is unavailable if Xwayland wasn't
  installed on the system

49.0.1
==========

* Follow-up for permissions issue fix, making the fix work in more environments

49.0
==========

* Translation updates
* Fix build failures when built without plymouth support
* Fix permissions issue on the GDM work dir (/var/lib/gdm) that broke settings
  persistence

49.rc
==========

* Translation updates
* Fixed a bug in PAM config files, introduced by transition to dynamic users
* Added logic to retry preferred display server (usually Wayland) before falling
  back (usually to X11)
* Fixed a bug where Plymouth keeps running if not display is plugged into the
  system. This would prevent bootup from completing and would prevent the user
  from logging in on a serial console
* Fixed GDM's session file loading logic to search directories in correct
  precedence order
* Fix simpledrm device detection to match the kernel's new device naming scheme
* Re-enabled X11 support by default. We found it difficult to cleanly separate
  GDM's ability to launch modern X11 sessions (which we intended to keep enabled
  in GNOME 49) from the rest of GDM's X11 integration (which we intended to
  disable but leave intact for GNOME 49). We still plan to remove GDM's full
  X11 integration in a future version, and leave only the ability to launch
  modern X11 sessions.
* Worked around a regression introduced by the switch to dynamic users, where
  the login screen no longer persists any settings

49.beta
==========

* Translation updates
* Switch to using dynamic users for greeter sessions. This enables systemd-based
  session management on the greeter, removes GDM's dependency on dbus-daemon,
  and frees us to drop gnome-session's builtin service manager.
* Adapt to changes in gnome-session 49, which dropped the builtin service manager
  code and now exclusively relies on systemd for session startup. This means that
  GDM now depends on gnome-session 49.

49.alpha.1
==========

* Drop dependency on Wacom g-s-d plugin  [Jordan; !301]
* Drop leftover udev rules  [Alessandro; !299]
* Fix warning when building without libxdmcp support  [Florian; !300]
* Add polkit rules to allow access to smartcards [David, !287]
* Misc [Joan; !298]
