Tue Jun 12 19:26:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: when running scripts always set the right
	  USER/LOGNAME etc...  Thanks to Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano
	  <nando@ccrma.stanford.edu> for pointing this out.

Tue Jun 12 18:14:32 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:  do version checking
	  and allow restarting gdm if possible, or at least rebooting and
	  telling the user what is happening

Sun Jun 10 17:13:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: fix CONSOLE_HELPER test

	* gui/gdmwm.c: follow the motif deco hint a bit, and do better job of
	  placement, and also do a hack to correctly place gkrellm.

Wed Jun 06 16:51:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing, daemon/gdm.c: try gdialog if we can't find
	  standard dialog, that might work as well.

Wed Jun 06 06:03:41 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am: add -f to mv

Wed Jun 06 00:59:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am: do the conditional chooser build
	  in a kosher way that actually works

Wed Jun 06 00:41:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am: when compiling without xdmcp
	  don't compile the chooser

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmchooser.c: Use gdmwm for window management
	  and query xinerama as well.  Also do manage on doubleclick

	* daemon/choose.c, daemon/xdmcp.c: Some obvious fixes, note that
	  indirect lookup will NOT return an expired Indirect thingie. 
	  Still need to figure out where does the chooser plug in.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmchooser.c: run gdmwm only when not debugging

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/errorgui.[ch],
	  daemon/Makefile.am:  Deal with the hanging bugs by doing an exec
	  before running the gtk gui.  Also make the gui use GNOME to be
	  prettier.  I'm less and less sure I like this hack and it might
	  move into a separate binary, though this way it is faster as
	  gdm is already paged in.  This also fixes some i18n problems
	  with the error dialog.

Tue Jun 05 21:27:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: fix hanging related to centering of dialogs.

Mon Jun 04 20:45:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, gdmconfig-security(.in), gdm.spec.in:
	  cleaned up the pam stuff ala gnome-utils

	* configure.in, accconfig.h, daemon/xdmcp.[ch], daemon/gdm.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): Detect the xdmcp libs and compile
	  without xdmcp support if not found and allow selecting this
	  option ala the xinerama one.  The configurator will disable
	  the xdmcp options if they aren't compiled in

	* daemon/gdm.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): Apparently
	  5 seconds is useful for timed login so lower the minimum from 10
	  to 5

Sun Jun 03 04:55:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h: remove unused opcode (GDM_STOP)

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: On GDM_QUIT the login will make
	  sure to quickly quit and in the slave we no longer kill it to
	  avoid a possible race, also try to avoid other races todo with
	  killing things.  Also fclose the greeter channel to avoid a leak.

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c: get the size of the screen from
	  xinerama and center error dialog stuff.

Sat Jun 02 03:41:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.2.1

Sat Jun 02 02:14:37 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h: use 64 for the code for X failing and not 1 

Sat Jun 02 01:58:15 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: bump version

	* auth.c, xdmcp.c, cookie.c: fix clobering of cookies with zeros, only
	  reget hostname on local displays, correctly setup authentication for
	  local xdmcp case. reset umask to sane gdm value after setting the
	  use auth

	* gdm.c: cleanup, possible fd leak if there was a stale pid file

	* server.c: handle memory errors in cookie setup

	* slave.c: from xdm stole the idea of a bogus first client which
	  apparently fixes some things.  Also actually close initial display
	  on xdmcp session end.  Also make sure language is at least "C" if
	  we can't find any other language

	* slave.c: SECURITY! when reinitializing the display for another go,
	  first bake new cookies

Fri Jun 01 17:51:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: when sending GDM_QUIT to the greeter, first make
	  sure greet is FALSE to avoid a race, this fixes the bugs where
	  people couldn't log in.  Also added a bit of debugging.  Also fixed
	  a problem where on a failed execution of a script one would get two
	  slaves.

2001-05-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h: add config keys for show/disable the sessions that 
	are added in addition to those in /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions, so that
	admins can fully control the session list

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add abovementioned config keys

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_login_parse_config): honor these settings
	
Thu May 31 03:17:32 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: set euid/egid to 0 before verify check

	* daemon/slave.c: set euid/egid to 0 at a bunch of places just to
	  make sure that's how they're set.  When children want to exit they
	  shouldn't use the slave_exit function as that's dangerous to the
	  slave's health.  Instead use a new function for this which
	  doesn't do slave specific cleanup.  Also fix segfaults on startup.

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: the credential setting is supposed to be done
	  after openning a session.  Closing of a session is done silently as
	  well, jsut for good meassure as wel don't have anything to talk to
	  anymore anyway

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c: when reinitting ignore X errors
	  and do not reopen the display.  When openning the display the first
	  time, don't try so hard for a local display and instead wipe slave
	  and try again.

Wed May 30 21:43:21 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: make iconify button nicer by making it smaller and
	  adding more border around it

Wed May 30 19:17:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: fix permission setting, and open the source
	  before dest.  Though a bit pointless since jrb is apprently
	  rewriting the whole bit :)

Wed May 30 16:19:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):
	  Add a PingInterval xdmcp thingie which is a combination of
	  the xdm PingInterval and PingTimeout.

2001-05-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): remove ja.po and zh_TW.Big5.po. 
	ja.po contains invalid euc-jp. zh_TW.Big5.po causes gettext 
	to get upset but iconv likes it OK, so I don't know.

Wed May 30 04:00:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: Save session in
	  the gdm options file if requested from the chooser.  This is done
	  since it's no longer saved in gsm which is the sane behaviour
	  actually.

Wed May 30 02:13:53 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: run gnome-session with --failsafe in failsafe
	  gnome mode

Tue May 29 15:47:16 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/locale.alias: Add british/american english language choices

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Add the POSIX/C locale if it doesn't exist

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Make the minimize button like an actual minimize
	  button instead of an arrow.  It's a black line in the bottom of the
	  button.  Also turned on the relief again as it looks better like
	  that now I think.

Tue May 29 00:38:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: ignore .rpmorig files as well,
	  and some cosmetic code changes

Mon May 28 02:24:43 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fixed a stupid mistake cased by a missed warning,
	  not really that crucial since the default config has no failsafe
	  X servers, because AFAIK, no such beast exists yet

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/slave.c:  In case the
	  language doesn't have '_' as the third character it's a communist
	  and must be executed.  Or perhaps we should just read the alias
	  file and translate it.  This should really only happen if sysadmin
	  and screwed up or the user has a very old setting from pre 2.2 days

Sun May 27 23:39:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/PostSession, config/PreSession: Don't change utmp since
	  there is no "terminal", debian bug #90981

Thu May 24 16:05:32 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.2

Thu May 24 15:32:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gdm-restart.in, Makefile.am: a script to restart
	  the gdm daemon, in sbin for root pleasure only

	* gdm.spec.in: redo the file list to be hopefully sane

	* daemon/gdm.c: actually read in GdmConfigurator

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: show help fromt he help button

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmwm.[ch]: add some short-circuit functions
	  for window moving, bypassing the window management foo.  This makes
	  quiver nice again.

Thu May 24 13:22:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: add ms (Bahasa Melayu), the official Microsoft
	  locale, for translations by Khairulanuar Abd Majid <khai@jaring.my>

Thu May 24 12:55:05 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, docs/Makefile.am, omf-install/Makefile.am,
	  docs/sgmldocs.make, docs/gdmconfig/C/Makefile.am, Makefile.am:
	  Set up the documentation/omf build stuff.

	* docs/gdmconfig/C/gdmconfig.sgml: fix version to say 2.2.2 and this
	  is part of the GDM package not the Gnome-Core package :)

Wed May 23 23:31:00 2001  Trevor Curtis <trevor.curtis@home.com>
	
	* docs/gdmconfig/C/gdmconfig.sgml: Added the expert and system
	  descriptions.

	* docs/gdmconfig/C/figures: Was created to put the screenshots
	  in for the gdmconfig doc.

	* docs/gdmconfig/C/figures/*: added the following png's; 
	  GDM_auto_login.png, GDM_background.png, GDM_chooser.png,
	  GDM_enviro.png, GDM_face_brow.png,  GDM_full.png, 
	  GDM_login_appear.png, GDM_login_behav.png, GDM_login_sessions.png,
	  GDM_menubar.png, GDM_misc.png, GDM_paths.png, GDM_security.png, 
	  GDM_xdmcp.png, GDM_xserv_setup.png

Mon May 21 11:31:35 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/Makefile.am: Eeek, we were
	  using the gnome_datadir_file function so when gdm was installed in
	  a different prefix we didn't do too well.  Make a define for our
	  own installation and first look there.

Sun May 20 19:32:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Fix some
	  spelling errors and gramatical weirdness as pointed out by
	  Christian Rose <menthos@menthos.com>

Fri May 18 04:17:00 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, docs/C/gdm.sgml,
	  config/gdm.conf.in, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):  Add a config
	  option for a failsafe X server which is emtpy by default

Fri May 18 00:16:58 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Makefile.am: don't overwrite gnomerc on install, that's bad
	  juju

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: update for the XKeepsCrashing stuff

Thu May 17 15:44:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Makefile.am: install factory settings, and for most settings
	  files, overwrite the current and save the current in .orig files.
	  this way changes will propagate.  Don't do this for gdm.conf
	  however, this is the most likely to be modified by the user.

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmphotosetip.desktop.in, gui/gdmphotosetup.c:
	  a small proggie to setup the face for a user.  Should at some point
	  become a crapplet and include all the gdm user settings

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade): fix some segfaults, include a factory
	  settings reverting, and move the exclude users to the face
	  browser as that's where it belongs

Thu May 17 03:38:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix segfault in the login entry checking code 

Thu May 17 02:52:38 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, confgiure.in, debian/Default.debian,
	  config/Makefile.am:  Don't put the debian stuff into the tarball,
	  and remove it from the config, this is here for people wanting to
	  live off the bleeding edge of 2.0-beta4 and run a stable gdm.
	  Hopefully the gdm 2.2.x packages will show up in mainstream debian
	  soon (they don't seem to be there now).  Plus some make distcheck
	  fixes

Thu May 17 01:27:15 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing, config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch],
	  daemon/server.c, config/Makefile.am, daemon/slave.c: Added a script
	  to run when X keeps crashing, this will run an X configuration
	  tool (after asking for root password of course), only works
	  on systems with /usr/bin/open (linux only I suppose) and XFree86
	  for now.

	* gui/Makefile,am:  fix make dist issues

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): fix some issues, move debugging into it's
	  own page and add the keeps crashing options from above

Wed May 16 15:10:07 2001  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (update_clock): Have clock update only once a
	minute.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_screen_init): add missing declaration to
	make it compile.

Tue May 15 17:36:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Apply patch from Remi@Cohen-Scali.com (Rémi
	  Cohen-Scali) to fix #54723.  The sessions were not strduped when
	  put into the global list.  Bad bad gdm :)

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c:  when xdmcp is disabled and no
	  servers exist and we can find /usr/bin/X11/X, this would mean that
	  the user is an idiot and deleted all servers.  So add one for him
	  and give him a warning before letting him log in and fix things.
	  also graphically complaina bout not being able to start the
	  greeter.

	* daemon/gdm.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: Don't abort on recoverable errors
	  that wouldn't be security problems.  Also allow things to be run
	  without a config file, using the defaults

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c: fix the default for the welcome
	  string, overcoming gnome-config idiocy

	* gui/gdmconfig.c:  Warn user if he removed all servers.

Tue May 15 15:28:57 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/slave.c: Don't abort when a binary isn't
	  found, instead try running the default binary and always give
	  graphical errors.  Since we allow graphical hosification, we need
	  to allow graphical unhosification as well, and thus gdm must be
	  able to run in some default mode under adverse conditions.  It is
	  still possible to utterly hose the system, but less so now.

	* gui/gdmconfig.c:  Interactively check commands, directories and
	  files for existance and display them in red if they don't.  This
	  way the user has immediate feedback that he is going to hose stuff
	  without having to actually try the hosing.

	* configure.in:  Fix the standard path defines

Tue May 15 02:39:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmwm.c: fix focusing windows on enter notify 

Tue May 15 02:14:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:  gdmlogin cannot
	  fetch user pictures.  SO there is now an interface so that the
	  slave can check/fetch the pictures for gdmlogin.  Unfortunately
	  imlib is braindead so the way we pass the pictures is to write them
	  to a temp file.  So this is even less friendly on large systems.
	  Paranoia is high however so there should not be a way to exploit
	  it.  Unless you find a pic that kills imlib in which case you can
	  run a dos, so this isn't an option for all systems anyway.

Mon May 14 23:54:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Browser fixes.  Do smarter sizing of the browser
	  window, align logo to the right to make it look nicer, fix warning
	  when logo image missing, exclude root from browser if he wouldn't
	  be allowed in anyway, fix reading of users, rewind the pw entry

	* config/gdm.conf.in: change default locale from english to en_US,
	  since not everything can properly dealias these things
	  unfortunately

Mon May 14 22:42:51 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c:  setup the environment better for the greeter
	  and setup the actual HOME if it exists etc... This makes it nicer
	  for BackgroundProgram's.  so if say the user wants to run a
	  gnome program (which require a writable home dir) he can just
	  create /home/gdm (or whatever it's in /etc/passwd)

Mon May 14 22:20:09 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/Makefile.am: install the index.html file correctly on make
	  install.  For those weirdos like me that run out of CVS

Mon May 14 21:52:53 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml:  Add proper copyrights/authors for me and Tim Jensen
	  and update the configuration section with all the new keys.

	* config/gdm.conf.in:  Run configurator with --disable-sound and
	  --disable-crash-dialog

Mon May 14 20:53:16 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade), gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add a
	  boolean flag for both timed and automatic login.  This makes
	  configuring it nicer and easier to understand

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add a clock, perhaps there should be a config
	  option about this

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmlanguages.[ch], gui/Makefile.am:  Add a
	  somewhat primitive (unfinished) framework for translating language
	  names.  Unfortunately names are hardcoded, though available
	  languages are still read from locale.alias.

Mon May 14 03:16:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: in the error dialog thing do the button click
	  mapping as well

Mon May 14 02:15:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: define RUNNING_UNDER_GDM for gdmlogin and gdmconfig

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c:  When RUNNING_UNDER_GDM is defined
	  we treat button click 3 like 1 since the user could be left
	  handed but has not yet logged in.

Mon May 14 00:55:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmwm.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c: Clean up stuff,
	  move the WM stuff into a separate file, make it run on a separate
	  X connection, add a cool shadow to windows, do more correct window
	  management, and all windows are managed now.

Sun May 13 13:09:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Simplify filters and only use the Substructure
	  mask thing.  Handle border correctly (to make xclock look cool)

	* daemon/server.c:  Eeek, HUP and TERM should have been DFL and not
	  IGN though the X server didn't seem to mind.  Also set TTIN and
	  TTOU to IGN since that's what happens when I startx apparently,
	  I think this may be responsible for the X server dieing on me
	  on unsuspend

Sun May 13 04:40:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Add a tooltip to the iconify arrow

Sun May 13 04:36:14 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdmlogin.c: recenter windows when they resize, add a single
	  black line decoration to make it easy to distinguish windows
	  layered on top of each other (such as in the configurator)

Sun May 13 00:59:48 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* AUTHORS, NEWS, README: updated

	* Makefile.am, RELEASENOTES: removed, no longer needed and horribly
	  useless and confusing to users

Sat May 12 23:44:38 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: add configuration summary, fix libwrap detection
	  and add configuration options to enable/disable xinerama
	  tcpwrappers and choose the authentication scheme

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c:  don't ask for
	  passwords on passwordless logins, fix a leak, and make crypt
	  support actually compile.  Also check password before testing if
	  the account is disabled.

	* daemon/slave.c:  Focus first X window with res_name "xterm" when
	  running the failsafe xterm session

Sat May 12 19:32:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: when we don't find the wrappers library don't add
	  it to LIBS

Sat May 12 19:28:30 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c: Add .dpkg-old to the list of
	  extentions to ignore

Sat May 12 16:47:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Xsession: check for freetemp existing

Sat May 12 15:23:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: properly check for NULLs on cursess and curlang.
	  Never, NEVER make the default session the last session, shit, the
	  entire point of that would not work, there is no Last session when
	  you use the default (that's the whole idea:).  Be more anal on the
	  language stuff as well, avoiding possible cases of crashing and
	  warnings.

Thu May 10 00:29:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): Add setting
	  (which is default) to only set background color on remote logins.

	* gdm/gdmlogin.c:  Icon has a tooltip now, and a bunch of the menu
	  items as well

	* config/gdm.conf.in, config/gdm.h, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade),
	  gui/gdmlogin.c:  Allow color to "seep through" transparent images
	  and thus the color selector is on even for images.  Add a setting
	  for only allowing color on remote logins.  This is useful to avoid
	  net traffic.

Wed May 09 18:19:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Center all mapped windows, also disallow
	  negative positions in centered windows.  Also clip size of
	  windows to the screen size.

	* daemon/gdm.h, acconfig.h, configure.in:  Make sure proper defaults 
	  are read in.  That is, if gdm.conf is missing the result should be
	  same as the supplied gdm.conf.  Also make ConfigAvailable=true the
	  default.  It will always query for root password so it's safe.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c: When resetting after
	  config don't quiver.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: properly translate failsafes

	* daemon/slave.c:  properly test for existance/executability of
	  just the path not arguments, and don't test for read on session
	  executions.

	* daemon/server.c:  Properly XSync before popping error handler

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c:  Check for
	  xinerama and start error dialogs and xterm failsafe at the
	  correct offset.

	* daemon/slave.c: Properly handle focus on the error dialog

Tue May 08 16:38:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Actually make the xinerama scaling thing work.
	  Also limit the dragging to within xinerama screens and avoid
	  dead space.  Allow jumping in between xinerama screens when
	  dragging as well.

Mon May 07 17:12:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/icon-entry-hack.c: update from gnome-core to fix selection
	  dialog issues

Sun May 06 22:27:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: support xinerama in background scaling and scale
	  image onto each screen rather then onto the entire screen

Sun May 06 16:31:07 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Failsafe*, config/Makefile.am, configure.in, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  daemon/gdm.h: Use our built in Failsafe thingies since they're more
	  safe from hosage.  Also be nicer in translating them and add some
	  tooltippage.

	* config/Xsession, config/Gnome.in:  Load in the xresources and
	  modmap and such magic.  Make it work on both rh6 and rh7 and
	  hopefully others.

	* daemon/slave.c:  Add more errors and pass some nice parameters
	  to the failsafe thingies.

Sun May 06 05:36:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: use the "Default" script if found as default

	* config/Gnome.in:  Read in ~/.Xresources, we need more magic
	  in this script however.

Fri May 04 18:10:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.1

Thu May 03 18:28:04 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c,
	  gui/misc.[ch]:  Add a misc functions file and add
	  strcasecmp_no_locale and use it.  Without this we fail in all kinds
	  of wird locale (like iso -9)

Thu May 03 17:13:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmchooser.c:  Use DOING_GDM_DEVELOPMENT env
	  var (scrap the old GDMCONFIG one for gdmconfig) and add actual
	  useful messages when glade stuff fails (as it does in ximian
	  packages now, but that makes a nice core file in those which sucks)

Thu May 03 13:22:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmconfig.desktop(.in), po/POTFILES.in,
	  po/*.po, configure.in, Makefile.am:  Add the usage of
	  xml-i18n-tools for the desktop file

Wed May 02 18:08:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: fix limits on the spinbuttons

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Fix default linking, provide uniqueness checking
	  fix naming races, and generally make the whole session editor
	  actually work right.

Wed May 02 03:15:15 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: fix running of gdmconfig by setuid/gid to 0
	  and give an error dialog box if the configurator is not found

Wed May 02 01:44:36 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in, config/Xsession: don't use bash -login, because we
	  have already ran a login shell which was the users login shell

	* config/gnomerc.in, daemon/slave.c: use exec to avoid running 2
	  unneeded shells.  Now if you log in there is no extra shell process
	  running.  This saves quite a bit of ram in fact since things like
	  bash eat up quite a bit of ram, and if the user doesn't use any
	  shells, none of it is shared.

	* daemon/slave.c:  Fix a doh! error in the last commit where I got
	  confused about which sessions I was talking about (gsm vs. gdm),
	  also a little bit of cleanup

Tue May 01 16:28:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmconfig.c,
	  gui/gdmlogin.c:  Make it possible to log in even if the sessions
	  directory is missing or empty.  Of course if that happens the
	  user gets a "you're an idiot and your setup's b0rk" warning dialog
	  (well not in those exact words)

Tue May 01 14:41:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: instead of a define, read a
	  DOING_GDMCONFIG_DEVELOPMENT env var.

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: ignore sessions ending in .deleted
	  and .desc

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Session names ARE case sensitive
	  so remove all this case insensitivity crap that could seriously mess
	  things up.  The only case insensitive thing is that the default
	  link can be case insensitive, the actual files are sensitive.

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade): fix an assload of stuff with respect to
	  the Session directory editting.  Not all tested though, so still
	  use at your own risk.  Though it theoretically has less problems
	  now.  Also cleaned up stuff a tiny bit.  This file could use a run
	  trhough indent.

Mon Apr 30 17:27:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix a couple of possible crashes with invalid images
	  being set.  Limit the logo size by just cropping the widget, that
	  way user will still be able to log in if he screws up the config

	* configure.in, config/gdm.conf.in:  Use the sbin path if using
	  console helper for the Configurator setting, else it won't work
	  right

Mon Apr 30 16:48:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm/gdm.[ch], gdm/verify-(pam|crypt|shadow).c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):  Add an option to toggle logging in
	  of root remotely.  So one can allow local root login but disallow
	  remote root logins.

	* daemon/slave.c:  add nicer error messages to all the exec failiures

Mon Apr 30 02:34:37 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, deamon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):  Split up the max sizes into normal
	  and another one for session files for which the limit is much
	  higher.  This is because session files are never read into memory,
	  but rather just scanned.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c:  When no session is set browse
	  through a list of possibles in order to find a good session.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/Makefile.am:  Link the slave to gtk libs,
	  and in case the session script doesn't exist isn't executable
	  or isn't readable, display an error instead of the session.

Sun Apr 29 23:54:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in, config/gnomerc, config/Makefile.am:  Revert stupid
	  changes, now we rely on a new enough gnome-core where gsm
	  understands GDM_GNOME_SESSION (in a similar way to GDM_LANG)

	* daemon/verify-*.c:  Eeeek Forgot to use the GDM_LOGIN prompter
	  opcode and that made the greeter very unhappy

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: Ignore .orig files as well when
	  looking at the Sessions dir

Sun Apr 29 22:46:12 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add running of
	  the configurator from the slave rather then the login which
	  doesn't work.  There is a special session setup for this so that
	  the user gets prompted for the root password first.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/server.c:
	  Only do the timed logins on the first local display just like
	  autologin.  We don't want to do simultaneous logins of the same
	  user on different screens really, that's usually bad.

	* daemon/gdm.c: Increase general paranoia and don't trust the greeter
	  and only allow reboots/config/halts when they are actually allowed
	  in the config file and only for local.

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade, gui/gdmconfig.c:  Add a bunch of tooltips,
	  and add the configuration stuff for the timed logins

Sun Apr 29 18:06:25 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.[ch],
	  daemon/verify.h, daemon/verify-(pam|crypt|shadow).c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in:  Create the concept of interruptions where the
	  greeter can interrupt a query to have the daemon do something.
	  and use it to do timeout logins, such as would be useful for
	  say a kiosk operation.  Only on local displays of course.
	  Originally based on the patch from Jim Bray.

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade:  Raise the maximum allowable max user file
	  size to 2^18 from 2^16

Sun Apr 29 21:40:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

        * gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade: Add the "run configurator"
	  options and gdmconfig path to gdmconfig itself. (hmmm).
	
	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade: Add a new notebook tab to
	  the expert panel that allows configuration of the 'Sessions'
	  directory; adding, editing, deleting & setting a new default are
	  currently supported.

Sun Apr 29 02:00:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in, config/Makefile.am:  Always install gnomerc
	  and Gnome even if they already exist, this is because we may
	  want to change these and want these changes to propagate.  Not
	  a perfect solution since it's not clear which config files are
	  editable without the install mucking them up, but oh well.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(glade|c):  Parse the session and session options
	  file and pass the sessions to the greeter if Gnome Chooser session
	  is selected.  The chooser then allows the picking of one specific
	  gsm session or the creation of a new one.  We set an env var
	  GDM_GNOME_SESSION with the session name in it.

	* daemon/gdm.c:  doh!  on automatic login actually use the saved
	  language and session

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: the execution of background prog and config now
	  closes all descriptors and opens /dev/null for stdin/out/err.  Also
	  the config program is killed on exit just like the background prog
	  and we don't allow starting multiple config programs.

Sat Apr 28 16:01:48 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Remove the overlay window crap and write a simple
	  windowmanager.  Yeah I feared this would happen one day.  Focus
	  now works properly finally, focus shows and GTK+ seems happy.
	  This also makes it possible to have the background clients have
	  sane focus management (with sloppy focus).  Though no frames,
	  window movement, nor icons.  (the login window still manages
	  it's frame, movement and icon itself)

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.glade:  Add a setting for disabeling the titlebar,
	  apaprently some people hate it and I'd rather this be done by
	  configuration then patches.  Then the user can easily reenable it.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: a little bit of work on the session chooser dialog
	  still doesn't actually do anything

Sat Apr 28 17:50:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

        * gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in: Add the option
	  (and relevant paths in the config) to run gdmconfig from the system
	  menu in gdmlogin. Disabled by default for obvious reasons. This
	  closes bug #53783.

Fri Apr 27 16:41:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, config/Gnome.in: 
	  Start on gsm session support.  Still doesn't work.  Also make gdm
	  session strings translatable.  At least some of the standard ones,
	  not perfect but oh well, who cares.

Tue Apr 24 18:45:55 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/PostSession, config/PreSession, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Apply
	  small bits of the ximian patches.  Pre/PostSession scripts only
	  run sessreg if it exists.  and gdmlogin selects the Gnome session
	  if no "default" exists.

Tue Apr 24 15:04:56 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: set the menu separators to insensitive to make
	  keyboard navigation nicer

Mon Apr 23 22:34:24 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: always draw the focus correctly and hardset the
	  gtk focus flag.  Hmm, I'm beginning not to like all this focus
	  voodoo that gdmlogin does.

Mon Apr 23 22:04:24 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h, daemon/auth.c, daemon/misc.[ch],
	  daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify.h,
	  daemon/verify-(pam|crypt|shadow).h:  Fixup enviroment issues.
	  Clear the environment before running a session and before launching
	  the greeter (taking care to save the localisation vars).  Also
	  don't set user env on the slave and leave it, if we set it it's
	  only temporary.  Also fix one possible crash by strduping the
	  pam env since that will go away and putenv doesn't strdup.

Mon Apr 23 20:16:07 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: when we find libwrap.a instead of specifying that
	  filename, use -lwrap which may be better on some systems

Mon Apr 23 20:08:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  if no LANG/LC_ALL is set, use the GdmDefaultLocale
	  setting as our locale.

Mon Apr 23 18:49:55 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  fix buffer overrun in making the enriched string

Sat Apr 21 11:46:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/icon-entry-hack.[ch]: update hack from panel

Thu Apr 19 17:32:36 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml:  Update the VerboseAuth and AllowRoot sections
	  to reflect what actually happens nowdays.

Thu Apr 19 13:18:59 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c,
	  daemon/verify-pam.c:  Fix GdmAllowRoot (it only worked in verbose
	  mode), made the verbose mode selection useful without being
	  insecure, and in nonverbose mode you still get "Login incorrect"
	  message as those are safe.  In pam mode we now check for 
	  root as well.  We also now check for shell to be /bin/false as
	  a sign the user was disallowed from logging in.

Thu Apr 19 03:48:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: don't search for shells, that's wrong, if the
	  user doesn't have a shell set, we are supposed to use straight
	  /bin/sh.  On linux this makes no difference anyway since that was
	  bash.  Also detect /bin/false shells and have a better error
	  message in that case in the log file.  We should detect those
	  earlier I suppose.

Thu Apr 19 02:11:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Return to gid 0 after verify check, patch from
	  rmurray+gnome@cyberhqz.com (Ryan Murray)

	* daemon/auth.c: refetch the hostname each time the cookie is
	  generated to deal with changing hostnames again from Ryan

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: remove the display mutilating code for enriched
	  string, again from Ryan

	* daemon/server.c: Move logfile open after fork as it's only
	  really used by the X server process (And that's the purpose of it)
	  Again, from, you guessed it, Ryan

	* daemon/slave.c: set gid after uid to 0 so that it doesn't fail
	  (from Ryan again)

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: do a gtk_main_quit in the QUIT handler, hopefuly
	  won't cause races, and this is actually by me

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: another one from ryan, set the password max entry
	  length to 128 to allow for MD5 password things

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: another one, this one to allow keyboard navigation
	  of the menus

	* daemon/slave.c: call initgroups to set up the groups correctly,
	  from ryan

	* daemon/slave.c: fixed problem of NULL lang/session returns, pointed
	  out by ryan

Wed Apr 18 22:32:53 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, debian/Makefile.am: fix make distcheck
	  wrt libintl and make sure we get the debian directory into the
	  tarball

Tue Apr 17 17:01:59 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.glade, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add option for not
	  scaling the background to fit, and tiling instead.  I think
	  I might just implement more like the original background
	  selection thingie for the desktop.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Apply a patch (and massage it a bit) from
	  rmurray+gnome@cyberhqz.com (Ryan Murray) to make the locale
	  menu just not display if the locale file is missing.

2001-04-17  Ian McKellar  <ian@eazel.com>

	* acinclude.m4:
	Removed this - it contained out of date gettext stuff that was 
	screwing up my build.

	* config/Default.debian:
	* config/Makefile.am:
	* configure.in:
	* debian/.cvsignore:
	* debian/README.Debian:
	* debian/changelog.in:
	* debian/changelog.old:
	* debian/control:
	* debian/copyright:
	* debian/dirs:
	* debian/docs:
	* debian/ex.doc-base.package:
	* debian/gdm.pod:
	* debian/gdmchooser.pod:
	* debian/gdmlogin.pod:
	* debian/init:
	* debian/postinst:
	* debian/postrm:
	* debian/rules:
	Added Debian build stuff and default config. It shouldn't break
	builds on other platforms, but it might.

Sun Apr 15 12:58:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix mispelling thanks to jrb

Fri Mar 30 18:17:00 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: up version to 2.2.1, and check for GdkPixbuf

	* config/Default, config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h, gui/Makefile.am,
	  gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade,
	  gui/gdmconfig.h, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add background image/color
	  setting and remove that setup from the Default init.

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/icon-entry-hack.[ch]:
	  Put in the icon entry hack fromt he panel to make the icon
	  entry behave properly

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Make overlay window override redirect, don't
	  proxy keyboard events to entry when window is iconified, raise
	  window when moving, raise window on uniconify, set initial manual
	  position after realize to avoid manual position being an offscreen
	  one properly, only allow one query dialog to be up

Mon Mar 12 16:21:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.0

Mon Mar 12 16:08:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade:  Remove the scrolled window
	  and make the window initially not shown so that the size doesn't
	  flicker.  Also nuke the hardcoded width and height.  Still has
	  some issues with really large fonts, but works good enough for a
	  release now.  Also set the side help string again, and comment out
	  the DOING_DEVELOPMENT define :)

Mon Mar 12 23:20:15 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Use a notebook instead of doing the container
	  voodoo. This should sort out the widget packing.

Fri Mar 09 21:00:03 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: Be slightly nicer to people with fonts
	  that aren't pretty small.

2001-03-12  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.desktop: Added Swedish strings.

Sun Mar 11 20:23:55 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: follow the xinerama screen size/position for
	  the icon as well.

Sat Mar 10 19:36:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: remove the clear message before first prompt hack,
	  and make it, clear after first return hack.  Also add a hack to
	  accumulate pam messages rather then replacing them in between
	  queries.  This fixes the weird clearing bugs with respect to
	  say expiring passwords.  Also clear message on GDM_RESET

Thu Mar 08 21:00:03 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Change (lack of) help message.

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: Set the initial height to be more
	  representative of what it's like when the containers have been
	  packed. Also do a little bit of container voodoo so the main panels
	  are in a viewport, (makes gdmconfig more usable on small screens).

Thu Mar 08 00:37:12 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: Fixups, move the security dir as well and
	  hardwire the sysconfdir to /etc as that seems broke on my 6.2 box
	  otherwise

	* configure.in: raise version to 2.2.0, no there isn't a release yet,
	  this is just to start rumors of an upcoming one.  (Plus I wanted
	  to build myself an rpm for my own use, cuz I'm not 'l33t 'nuff
	  to build on my system from cvs directly)

Wed Mar 07 22:50:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: minor fixups from the merge

2001-03-07  Gregory Leblanc <gleblanc@cu-portland.edu>

	* gdm.spec.in: much better macros, and better portability.  Please
	read the %ChangeLog section in the spec file for details.

Mon Mar 05 18:17:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* AUTHORS, README, README.install:  Do a quick update as it's all
	  horribly out of date.

Mon Mar 05 23:41:40 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

        * gui/gdmconfig.[ch]: Fix bug that caused only values of 0 and 1 for
	  RelaxPerms to be used/written.

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: Change RelaxPerms toggle to 3 radio buttons,
	  and remove some old cruft.

Mon Mar 05 22:42:54 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

        * gui/Makefile.am: Change shared directory for glade files
	  to allow centralised storage of all gdm .glade files.
	  Link gdmchooser against libglade.
	
	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Use new location for glade files.
	
	* gui/gdmchooser.c: Gladeify gdmchooser and give it a slightly
	  less sucky GUI.
	
	* gui/gdmchooser.glade, gui/gdmchooser-strings.c: Added GUI and
	  translatable strings for updated gdmchooser.
	  
	* gui/*.glade: Ensure WM_Class is set to be 'gdm' everywhere.
	
	* gdm.spec.in: Adjust paths for new glade file and location.

Sun Mar 04 16:28:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/filecheck.[ch]: fix an error message and make const correct

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: make the photo checking code saner, this assumes
	  we're root and can read anyone's files, really and this is bad,
	  oh well, it is sort of weird.  Also a bunch of cleanup and
	  constization.

	* gui/Makefile.am: don't link to filecheck anymore

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: cleanup some code, make GDM_QUIT
	  work for doing cleanup.  Make it not actually quit but just
	  cleanup to prepare to be killed.

Sun Mar 04 12:27:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Added a note to the config file about running
	  X on a specific console.  Mostly for packagers, apparently the
	  debian packages were broken in this respect.

Sun Mar  4 16:13:55 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

        * docs/gdmconfig/*: Added initial directory structure/files for
	the gdmconfig user guide. Not installed yet.
	
	* docs/gdmconfig/C/gdmconfig.sgml: Initial gdmconfig user guide
	content from Trevor Curtis <trevor.curtis@home.com>.

Wed Feb 28 19:23:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c:  Apply patch from "Matthias Clasen"
	  <Matthias.Clasen@poet.de>, to fix issues with xdm.

Web Feb 28 18:47:14 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

        * gdmconfig-pam, gdmconfig-security: New files to support
	priviledged non-root users running gdmconfig.
	
	* Makefile.am, configure.in, gdm.spec.in: Add option to configure
	to --enable-console-helper for gdmconfig.

Tue Feb 27 16:44:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: apply patch from Vlad Harchev <hvv@hippo.ru>
	  to not force the adobe helvetica font and to exclude postgres and
	  pvm users by default

Tue Feb 27 13:27:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

        * gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade:
	Fix version number and add bugzilla URL to about box.

2001-02-27  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gdmconfig/Makefile.am: removed DLOCALEDIR.
	* gdmconfig/gdmconfig.c/h: include config.h in c file, not h.
	i18n fixes, gui now translated.

Tue Feb 27 00:25:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.99

Tue Feb 27 00:25:09 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/xdmcp.c:  Fixed xdmcp closing routine, and
	  close the xdmcp fd before restarting after a HUP so that xdmcp
	  doesn't fail.  If we fail when initting xdmcp don't die, but just
	  disable xdmcp and continue after screaming stuff into syslog.

Wed Feb 21 01:46:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, config/Default: Setup cursor in gdmlogin

Tue Feb 20 13:57:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Default: Idea from peter winnberg <peter@rsub.com>, to set
	  the cursor to left_ptr to be nicer

Mon Feb 19 09:01:56 2001  Yukihiro Nakai <nakai@gnome.gr.jp>

	* gui/gdmconfig.desktop: Add Japanese translation.

Mon Feb 19 21:37:07 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Patch from Tim Jansen <tim@tjansen.de>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml:  fixed docs in terms of true/false vs. 1/0 and
	  add new values

	 * gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmchooser.c:  change GdmDebug to gboolean
	   and add some checks for config values

2001-02-19  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@eikonex.org>

	* gui/gdmconfig.desktop: Added French strings.

Mon Feb 19 03:42:01 2001  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (create_handle): Minor UI cleanup to gdmlogin.

Sun Feb 18 15:05:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: Improve clarity, and make 'automatic login'
	more noticeable.

Sun Feb 18 11:32:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): GUI fixes for Xserver clist.

Sat Feb 17 19:08:00 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): Patch from Lee to fix xdmcp options
	  sensitivity, plus make the clist title passive and set it to
	  browse selection mode.

Thu Feb 15 03:18:15 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.98.1

Thu Feb 15 03:18:12 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, config/Gnome.in, config/Failsafe.in,
	  config/gdm.conf.in, config/gnomerc.in:  Fix the autogeneration,
	  by including all the prefixes and by expanding the variables.
	  Idea stolen from GConf configure.in

Wed Feb 14 18:53:57 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, config/Makefile.am: Apply patch from peter@ximian.com
	  (Peter Teichman), to generate config files from .in files during
	  configure time, rather then install time

	* gdm.spec.in: update for the above

Tue Feb 13 18:27:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c: Apply fix from "Matthias Clasen"
	  <Matthias.Clasen@poet.de> to make xmdcp work for him.  Also
	  massaged that function a bit further.  But it doesn't solve
	  my problems.

Mon Feb 12 02:18:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: remove a duplicate bindtextdomain foo, and remove
	  the default dialog pos is center thing since we explicitly set
	  this anyway.

Sun Feb 11 16:23:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.98

Sat Feb 10 18:05:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade): new update version of the configurator
	  from Lee Mallabone <lee@fonicmonkey.net> which makes it simpler to
	  do stuff.

Tue Feb 06 21:33:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-pam.c: pam cleanup done when slave
	  exitting.

Sun Feb 04 16:23:30 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.*: Apply patch from Lee Mallabone <lee@fonicmonkey.net>
	  To add a development define for debugging, and change a bit of
	  the layout to be more consistent.

Sat Feb 03 19:42:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c:  Fix corruption of GSLists on exit

Sat Feb 03 18:24:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xmdcp.c: apply some changes found in the gdm debian
	  paches, but they don't make any difference

Sat Feb 03 17:58:51 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Patch from Tim Jansen <tim@tjansen.de> to fix
	  a buffer overflow with xinerama support

Sat Feb 03 15:39:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: patch from Lee Mallabone <lee@fonicmonkey.net>, to
	  make gdmconfig actually work. (install the glade and desktop file)

Fri Feb 02 23:32:56 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.97.1

Fri Feb 02 20:03:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, config/Default.redhat, config/Failsafe.redhat,
	  config/Failsafe.in, config/Makefile.am, gdm.spec.in:  First
	  attempt at making an rpm.  Doesn't break the build, but I doubt
	  it works as I haven't tried it.  Will test on my laptop later.

Fri Feb 02 18:29:40 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: the xinerama support might badmach if run under
	  a non xinerama supporting xserver, so trap errors and just assume
	  one screen if we get errors.

Thu Feb 01 18:28:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.97

Thu Feb 01 18:26:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Add a hack so that if the Welcome string is
	  set to a default, use the gettext translation for added hack
	  value and more translations.

Thu Feb 01 17:58:30 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): some glade fixes, and add a reset option
	  when applying

	* daemon/gdm.h: use true/false for booleans in defaults

Thu Feb 01 17:05:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Apply an port a patch from <tim.jansen@systembureau.com>,
	  furhter modified default config (config/gdm.conf.in) and the 
	  configuratior (gui/gdmconfig.c) to include the screen option

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, configure.in: added support for Xinerama, 
          the new key greeter/XineramaScreen selects on which screen the 
          greeter will be centered

Thu Feb 01 04:49:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in:  Add gdm to the list of default excludes

	* daemon/gdm.c:  take HUP signal, which will unmanage all displays and
	  then re-exec itself.  This is a poor-mans reset, not integrated
	  with the configurator yet.

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/xdmcp.c:  Remove all loop of death catches except for the
	  slave restart one.  Move the server loop of death to display.c
	  as it must run in the master process, and it can now catch all
	  the error conditions without races.  Move sleeping to slave.
	  Kill many race conditions, some of them quite evil.  Kill the
	  greeter segfault detection, loop of death in display.c is enough
	  here.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  If LANG is set, use that for a default language,
	  preferring the DefaultLocale setting and use that only as fallback.
	  Instead of setting LANG to the name of the language, set it to
	  the proper unaliased string since our alias file may be different
	  from the system one.   And add a way to sort of get from codes to
	  langauge names.  Remove tolower ugly hack.

2001-01-31  Gediminas Paulasukas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade: fix some mistakes in
	strings.
	* config/locale.alias: added lithuanian.

Tue Jan 30 20:19:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Make quiver more visible and cooler looking (/me
	  thinks)

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Verbose Auth is on by default, since now it
	  doesn't reveal information,  Not sure if this option is useful
	  for anything really.  We want "Login Incorrect" messages all the
	  time.  May need some thought

	* daemon/verify-(crypt|shadow).c: Don't reveal what went wrong on
	  login, just say "Login incorrect"

Tue Jan 30 16:52:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Pfffffffffffffft!  Really apply the patch from ChiDeok Hwang
	  <hwang@mizi.co.kr>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdm.c:  Some locale stuff fixes.  This still
	  feels really wrong as it mostly ignores the systemwide setting and
	  uses it's own default most of the time.  And that's bad.  Needs
	  some work.

Tue Jan 30 19:08:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade: configuration
	  key fixes

	* gui/Makefile.am: add desktop and glade to extradist

	* gui/gdmconfig.desktop: start gdmconfig not gdmlogin (doh!)

Tue Jan 30 15:16:40 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade,
	  po/POTFILES.in: x18n fixes, add missing configuration options,
	  add warning dialog about when configuration will be applied,
	  fix up gboolean vs. int mess and it's related gnome_config stuff

Tue Jan 30 14:25:20 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Patch from ChiDeok Hwang <hwang@mizi.co.kr>:

	* config/locale.alias:  remove one of the entries for french as
	  that turns out to be blank on non -1 locales

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/verify-crypt.c,
	  daemon/verify-shadow.c: i18n fixes

	* daemon/slave.c: made user to see last message when gdm sleeps.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: empty other menu is ugly. So remove it when it is
	  empty.  gdm_slave_greeter_ctl(GDM_MSGERR, ...) was stalled waiting
	  output from gui.

	Patch from Lee Mallabone <lee@fonicmonkey.net>:

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am: make gdmconfig buile and depend on
	  libglade

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|desktop|glade): A working implementation of
	  the configuration.  Doesn't yet restart gdm and only works for root
	  (has no pam stuff), but much better then nothing.  Still missing
	  the new options for 2.1

2001-01-30  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added "nn" to ALL_LINGUAS.
	
Thu Jan 25 23:49:44 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.96

Thu Jan 25 23:04:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.[ch]: cleanup

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c, config/gdm.conf.in:  Add options
	  for setting the initial position to allow xinerama wankers to
	  make their login not suck too much.  Also added an option to
	  lock the window position and fixed some braindamages.  Fixed the
	  label style setting as well to work with non default themes.

Thu Jan 25 06:34:13 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: workaround non-working grabs, add a window title,
	  implement window moving (poor mans support of xinerama) and other
	  cleanup and fixes

Tue Jan 23 18:09:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: minor cleanups

Tue Jan 23 03:34:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: some cleanup in hunt for a fix of xdmcp

Mon Jan 22 21:02:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/xdmcp.c: fix
	  some xdmcp bugs, crashes, etc... random cleanup, autologin on the
	  first display started only, when killing things make sure kill
	  succeeded before waitpid, otherwise probably the process was
	  already dead and we'd just wait forever.  But don't expect XDMCP
	  to actually work now, it doesn't.

Mon Jan 22 02:59:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c, daemon/server.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/display.c:  Race fixes, remove old code, cleanups,
	  leak fixes, use the same X server process and use HUP to
	  reset it

Wed Jan 10 19:25:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, *: raise version and put in some notes in relevant
	  files

Wed Jan 10 13:57:56 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/slave.c:  A little bit of cleanup, if the greeter
	  segs 5 times during 40 seconds, unmanage the display
	  so that we don't hog the console.

Wed Jan 10 07:22:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/server.[ch], daemon/slave.c: When slave is exitting
	  we should kill the old X server really.  It should be possible to
	  reuse, but currently this was leading to hangs.  Also only
	  wait for the server if the kill worked to avoid hanging in
	  waitpid.

Wed Jan 10 03:20:48 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add empty line for automatic login (disabled)

	* daemon/server.c: If the server aborts during startup try restarting
	  it about 5 times

Wed Jan 10 02:32:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify.h, daemon/verify-*.[ch], daemon/slave.c: For
	  autologin we have to do the pam dance to setup stuff nicely.

Wed Jan 10 01:13:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in:  Move the background stuff to greeter as that
	  makes more sense

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: Add automatic logging in on the
	  first login (so most likely right after boot).  This is off by
	  default of course and will not autologin root.

Tue Jan 09 21:55:26 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, config/gdm.conf.in:  Add support
	  for running a background process and have it have the same lifetime
	  as the greeter.  This makes it easy to add things like screensavers
	  on the root and make them stop when you actually log in.

Tue Jan 09 18:50:51 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Many changes, too many to write a changelog for.  Applied most of
	  the redhat and helix patches.  On the login screen make a window
	  over the entire window and proxy key events back to the entry to
	  get xdm like keyboard grab behaviour without a grab.  When starting
	  local displays call gdm_display_manage to actually fork the slave.
	  Try cleaning up after self when messing with signal handlers.
	  When killing clients, ignore x errors.  Kill clients on the same
	  display connection since opening a new one won't work.  Kill the
	  alarm on the ping since it made no sense, and didn't work in the
	  first place.

2000-12-17  Marius Andreiana  <mandreiana@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in: Added ro (Romanian) to ALL_LINGUAS

2000-12-12  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Make it: 1) compile 2) pass make distcheck.
	* configure.in: one BAD BAD typo: s/aC/AC/
	* daemon/Makefile.am: add server.h
	* docs/C/Makefile.am: remove images.
	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: fix sgml.
	* po/Makefile.in.in: I dunno.

2000-11-28 Stanislav Visnovsky <visnovsky@nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added Slovak translation

2000-10-19  Yukihiro Nakai  <nakai@gnome.gr.jp>

	* configure.in: Add Chinese(GB2312, Big5) to ALL_LINGUAS

2000-08-29 Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@hispalinux.es>

	* daemon/misc.c,
	daemon/misc.h,
	daemon/slave.c,
	configure.in: Thread-safe wrapper for gdm_setenv, new function
	gdm_unsetenv. Change required for gdm basic funftionallity on some
	systems. On systems without setenv/unsetenv functions, gdm_(un)setenv
	still remains thread unsafe & POSIX safe!

2000-06-05  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Typo fix.

2000-05-11  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* daemon/display.c (gdm_display_lookup): New function.

	* daemon/server.c: Fixes.

1999-12-29    <mkp@mkp.net>

	* Checkin of my devel tree. Some of the new stuff is in. Mostly
 	infrastructure changes, though. Oh, and it doesn't actually work
 	yet. But it will eventually. Promise!

1999-12-26    <mkp@mkp.net>

	* daemon/verify-*.c: Move each authentication scheme to a separate
 	file (Sucks to be a translator :).

1999-12-21    <mkp@mkp.net>

	* daemon/verify.c (gdm_verify_user): Added fix for expired
 	passwords when using PAM (Philip Spencer
 	<pspencer@fields.utoronto.ca>).
  
1999-11-11    <mkp@mkp.net>

	* daemon/misc.c (gdm_setenv): New function to work around POSIX
 	brain damage.

1999-11-10  Yuri Syrota <rasta@renome.rovno.ua>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added uk.

1999-11-01    <mkp@mkp.net>

	* daemon/verify.c (gdm_verify_user): Error in error message.

	* daemon/slave.c (gdm_slave_greeter_ctl): Nuke random junk that
 	might have accumulated in the ipc pipe.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_login_ctrl_handler): Same as above.

	* configure.in: Fixed -lnsl (again)

1999-10-21  Sergey Panov <sipan@mit.edu>

        * configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added ru.

1999-10-03    <mkp@mkp.net>

	* daemon/slave.c: Misc. hacks to solve #2487. PAM messes with
 	pwent.

	Finally merged the Ottawa megapatch:

	* daemon/auth.c: Real XAuth implementation. Doesn't rely on

 	scratch. Face browser functionality will return eventually.
	
	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_parse_enriched_string): Applied patch from
 	Jacob Berkman to support sysname and release variable expansion.

1999-03-28  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

 	being. I'll implement a real PAM conversation function within the
 	next couple of days to take care of the exposed usernames issue.

	* src/gdmchooser.c: Done!
	
	* src/gdmchooser.c: First shot at reimplementing the code I

	locate the stale pid file.

	* configure.in (LIBWRAP_PATH): Use the same configuration
	mechanism for detecting a working libwrap library on the system
	(fixes crash).

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_greeter): Do not use sscanf to get the
	password, as it might contain spaces, just copy the string.
	(gdm_slave_get_opts): Use fgets directly on the target buffer. 
	(gdm_slave_get_opts): Make the strings empty at startup.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_logo_init): Use gnome-pixmap
	widget instead of gtk-pixmap.  Gnome-pixmap correctly uses the
	right visual and is simpler to use (and does not crash on
	multidepth visuals).
	(gdm_greeter_iconify_handler): Use gnome-pixmao here too.

1999-02-16  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmverify.c (gdm_verify_user): Repetetetive pam_setcred
 	spotted by gb. Fixed.

1999-01-22  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	buffer has an undefined value.

	* src/gdm.c (main): Set the umask to 066 to make any
	default file created indirectly by gnome-config be of mode 066. 

1999-01-13  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

 	scripts are executable before adding them to the list.

 	path. Create ~user/.gnome if it doesn't exist.

 	more than one local Xserver.

1999-01-12  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	(gdm_slave_greeter): Workaround for getenv("HOME") until miguel
 	fixes gnome_init().

	* src/gdmmisc.c (gdm_parse_enriched_string): Fallback if
 	getenv("HOSTNAME")==NULL.

1999-01-11  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/<younameit>.[ch] Done rewriting the daemon code to avoid the
 	race condition caused by simultaneous greeter/session and Xserver
 	death.

1998-12-30  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* src/gdmauth.c, src/gdmgreeter.c, src/gdmmisc.c,
	  src/gdmslave.c, src/gdmxdmcp.c:
	s/g_copy_strings/g_strconcat/

1998-12-28  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/*.c: Loads of fixes over the past couple of days.

 	tunable.

	* src/gdmmisc.c (gdm_file_check): Moved gdm_greeter_file_check
 	here. Now a generic function.

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_windows_kill_error_handler): Ok,
 	nailed down the bug which caused gdmslave to exit(1)
 	mysteriously. A race in the windows_recursive_kill function caused
 	the X default error handler to kick in. Blam. You're dead.
	
	(gdm_slave_session_init): Run sanity check on ~user/.Xauthority
 	and ~user/.gnome/gdm.

	(gdm_slave_exec_command): Use the passed pointer instead of
 	gdmSuspend.

 	sanity check.
	
	(gdm_greeter_file_check): New function. Checks file size,
 	ownership etc. to avoid DoS attacks on greeter.

1998-12-23  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdm.c (gdm_abort): New function for error logging and
 	aborting. 
	
	(gdm_config_parse): luser proof permissions checking on authdir.
	
	* src/gdmgreeter.c: Several oddities fixed.
	
	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_buttons_init): Mark login button
 	as default.
	
	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_login_entry_handler): Fixed event
 	handlers to avoid the obscure emit_stop bug. Turns out my ancient
 	event handlers were doing the right thing all along. Only the
 	recent ones were br0ked. *sigh*. Thanks Owen!

1998-12-22  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_greet_init): Removed debug logging of

 	<kvajk@ricochet.net>.

1998-12-14  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_browser_unselect): Catch
 	BUTTON_RELEASE.

1998-12-13  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_{reboot,halt}_handler): Use
 	gnome_question_dialog instead of message_box.

1998-12-03  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* config/Makefile.am: Fixed gnomerc. Both path and INSTALL_SCRIPT
 	were wrong -- No wonder people have been complaining. *sigh*

	* src/gdm.c (main): Abort with (xdm compliant :) error message if
 	gdm isn't started by root.

1998-12-01  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* docs/gdm-manual.txt: Crude manual draft.

	* src/gdm.c, config/gdm.conf.in: The PreRoot and PostRoot
 	directories have been renamed PreSession and PostSession to avoid
 	confusion.

1998-11-30  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_message_init): Calls the enriched
 	string function on the message string to support ``Welcome to
 	<hostname>''. Need to supply both server and client macros.

	* src/gdmmisc.c (gdm_parse_enriched_string): New function for %h
 	expansion in strings.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c: Removed legacy labels and such. gettext takes
 	it from here.

	* src/gdm.c (gdm_config_parse): Check for correct permissions on
 	vardir.

1998-11-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_browser_init): IconList now starts
	life in thawed mode.

1998-11-22  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_browser_select): Reverted to the
 	old event types (GDK_BUTTON_PRESS) for gnome-icon-list.

	* src/gdmslave.c, src/gdmgreeter.c, src/gdm.c: Added support for
 	suspending APM-aware machines from greeter.

1998-11-20  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c: Fixed X server restart stuff. gdmslave rewrite
 	done.

	* src/gdmslave.c, src/gdm.c, config/gdm.conf.in: Implemented
 	KillInitClients option (Requested by sct).

1998-11-18  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_display_init): Finally nailed down the
 	bug that has been haunting me for the past week causing
 	gdm_slave_windows_kill to hang on second login. The X server takes
 	a while to recover consciousness after a reset. I take this into
 	account by sleeping for a while if XOpenDisplay fails.
  	Unfortunately, dsp was already initialized in second run
 	(but invalid after the X server reset) causing my retry condition
 	to be ignored. Always check your pointers! *sigh*

	So, the new gdm should be as fast as xdm (i.e. fewer resets
 	causing garbled displays and momentary flicker. Visual annoyances
 	beyond this point - Go bug the X server people).
	
	SANE tutorial coming up in 6 hours. *Thud*
	
1998-11-09  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c More or less a rewrite.

1998-11-08  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_init): Add d->name when starting X
 	server.

 	searching and gdmLogDir. gdmLogFile deprecated.

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_init): Moved stdout, stderr logging
 	here. Logs are now per-display.

1998-10-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_browser_init): Icon List is born
	in frozen state, calling freeze and thaw leaves it still in frozen

1998-10-16  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* config/Makefile.am (install-data-hook): Make sure that
 	install-data-hook depends on targets gdm.conf gnomerc and Gnome.

 	the proper mode.

	(gdm_greeter_browser_init): Adapt to the new gnome-icon-list api.
	(gdm_greeter_login_entry_handler): Thaw before attempting to use moveto

	Martin, is there any reason why you clear() the icon lists
	contents and then reload them when the user changes from the login
	field to the password one?

	* src/gdm.c (main): Redirect all output to a logfile.
	
	* src/gdm.c (main): Moved the pid checking code to main to avoid
 	/sbin/init respawns. Checks whether gdm is started by init and
 	stops forking if this is the case (actually works this time).

	* config/gdm.conf.in (PidFile): I've been ignoring all bug reports
 	caused by this one. Turns out I made a typo in the config template
 	file. *sigh*

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_invalid_passwd_req): Set focus to
 	passwd field when auth fails.

	* src/gdmslave.c: Finished the rewrite. Should be almost usable
 	again.

	* config/Makefile.am: TODO: Need to find a way to prevent
 	overwriting gdm.conf when doing a make install.

1998-10-07  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_login): Completely new

	* src/gdmverify.c: New file. TODO: PAM detection in autoconf.

	* src/gdmslave.c: Gave up on merging CVS and my .ch-work. Started
 	major rewrite instead.

 	protocol. Waste.

1998-10-05  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c: Fixed the race reported on gnome-list the right
 	way. The posted fix broke X USR1 signalling.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_about): Bumped version
 	number. Whee.
	(gdm_greeter_done): New function. Partly replaces parse_results().
	(gdm_greeter_login): Former login_button_handler. Now passes
 	password through pipe. Disables input while gdmslave is thinking.
	(gdm_greeter_passwd_entry_handler): Replaced parse_results with
 	gdm_greeter_login to reflect the auth redesign.
	(gdm_greeter_invalid_passwd_req): Re-enable input and reset cursor
 	after requester has been acked.
	(main): Added signal handling for gdmslave communication.

1998-10-04  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdm.c: signal->sigaction stuff.
	(gdm_daemonify): Moved openlog to main.
	(main): Stop forking when ppid is init.

1998-10-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_init): Setup the signal before
	forking.  FIXME: We need to use sigaction all over the place
	instead of signal.

Thu Sep 24 22:09:39 CEST 1998 Jochen Friedrich <jochen@scram.de>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c: Fixed a memory corruption.

1998-09-15  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_usr1_handler): Added support for

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_user_alloc): Fix my oversimplication
	from last night.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_user_alloc): More simplification
	of the use of gnome-config.  I think I really should document it. 

	* src/gdm.h (gdm_slave_init): Add prototype.  Remove include to
	gnome.h.

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_usr1_handler): Log errors when the
	session can not be launched.
	Simplify the includes.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_parse_config): Simplify the code
	by using gnome_config_push_prefix
	(gdm_greeter_parse_config): Do not strdup the resulting strings,
	they are already dupped
	(gdm_greeter_sessions_init): Removed dependency on static buffer
	for s.  Find correcly the default session.

Tue Sep  8 16:11:49 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean

	* acconfig.h : added this file so one can cvs -z3 co gdm, cd gdm
	./autogen.sh; make and have an executable be spit out.
