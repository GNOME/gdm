	  primary message.

2006-12-05  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* vicious-extensions/ve-miscui.c, gui/gdmchooser.c: Cleaner
	  fix for same problem fixed in last commit.

2006-12-05  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* vicious-extensions/ve-miscui.c, gui/gdmchooser.c: Fix so
	  that if the "%" key is entered in the input field in 
	  gdmchooser, the secondary message in the error dialog
	  displays properly.  Also fix ve-miscui.c so that if "%"
	  exists in the secondary message, to not display it.
	  Message must have "%%" to display the "%" character.
	  This fixes CVE-2006-6105.

2006-12-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

        * Release 2.17.3:
        * configure.ac: Update to new release version.
        * NEWS: Updated.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Update version number.

2006-12-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/verify-pam.c:  Patch that makes the GDM daemon
	  (rather than the forked slave) cause all dialogs to be
	  displayed.  This improves accessibility for GDM because
	  any AT programs (such as GOK, Gnopernicus or Orca) which
	  are launched from GDM will now better work with such
	  dialogs.  This is needed because dialogs will show up
	  running as the user if they appear after authentication
	  and at this point the at-spi-registryd is running as the
	  gdm user.  We want all GDM dialogs to run as the gdm
	  user.  Patch by Leena Gunda <leena.gunda@wipro.com> and
	  Srirama Sharma <Srirama.Sharma@Sun.COM>.  Note that
	  there have been some reports that this change triggers
	  GDK bug #376315 on Linux when a11y is turned off.  This
	  will probably need to be fixed before the next stable
	  release.  I think this a11y fix is important enough to
	  introduce this bug in the development cycle.  Workaround
	  for now is to turn on a11y.

2006-12-01  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in.in.  Implement the tooltip suggestion
	  for gdmsetup suggested by Calum Benson.  Fixes bug #375634.

2006-11-28  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/Xsession.in config/default.desktop.in:  Since the
          default.desktop file really just runs the Xclients script
	  it should have a better name that specifies this is what
	  it does.   Modify the default fallback program if no
	  Xclients file exists to xterm since xsm isn't on all 
	  systems.  This is a safer fallback.  Patch by 
	  Padraig O'Briain <Padraig.OBriain@sun.com>, modified by
	  myself.

2006-11-28  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsession.c: Fix for TryExec check in gdmsession.c so 
	  that it does not pass arguments into g_find_program_in_path
	  since it causes it to say it is not executable if arguments
	  are passed in.

2006-11-27  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c, config/locale.alias: Rename Panjabi to
	  Punjabi.  Fixes bug #378724.

2006-11-22  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* NEWS:  Add 2.16.3 info.

2006-11-08  Lukasz Zalewski  <lukas@dcs.qmul.ac.uk>
	
        More changes related to bug #352924.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Made warnings more self-explanatory when no themes 
	  are selected in "Random from selected" mode. Enabled back the delete 
	  button on the "Random from selected" view for the currently selected
	  theme in the single theme view with a slight modification - users can
	  click on it but get told that they need to first deselect it from
	  "Single theme" mode first in order to delete it. Also upon closure if
	  users have activeted "Random form selected" but have not selected any
	  themes for it, they will be informed that the greeter will default to
	  single theme mode.
	
2006-11-06  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c, config/locale.alias:  Add 
	  Serbian and Montenegro languages.  Patch provided by
	  Peter Nugent <Peter.Nugent@sun.com>

2006-11-06  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

        * daemon/verify-pam.c: Update to make casting more clear.
          This fixes a problem noticed with the Kerberos PAM module.
          Kerberos was sending the proper error message but gdm was not
          accessing it properly.  This message comes as "struct pam_message"
          and is accesed using a double pointer "**msg".GDM was treating
          msg as a pointer to an array of "num_msg"s of "struct pam_message"
          whereas it actually is pointer to a pointer to an array of
         "num_msg"s of "struct pam_message".

2006-11-06  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

        * Release 2.17.2:

2006-11-04  Lukasz Zalewski  <lukas@dcs.qmul.ac.uk>
	
        Fixes bug #352924.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Added warnings when no themes are selected in
	  Random from selected mode. Random from selected option can only be 
	  enabled only and only if one or more themes are selected. Also 
	  disabled the delete button on the Random from selected view for 
	  the currently selected theme in the single theme view mode.

2006-11-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c, config/locale.alias:  Add several new

	(session_child_run), (gdm_slave_session_start):
	* docs/C/gdm.xml:

2006-10-31  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_customlist.c: Fix custom lists so
	  that focus does not leave the username/password entry field.
	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c: Minor cleanup.

2006-10-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

        * Release 2.17.1:
        * NEWS: Updated.
        * configure.ac: Update to new release version.
        * gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:

          since we don't have icons yet.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Fix docs.

2006-10-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: Minor fix to last patch.
	* gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml
	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml:  Add userlist
	  now that it will disappear if there are no users to display.

2006-10-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

        * gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.[ch],
          gui/greeter_item_pam.c:  Similar usability fixes for gdmgreeter.
          OK/Cancel buttons are now sensitive/insensitive (but only if
          using GTK style buttons), and the userlist now is not shown
          if there are no users.  Added a new item id "userlist-rect"
          which can be used to specify the rectangle containing the
          userlist, so it can also disappear when the userlist is
          empty.
        * gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/happygnome.xml:  Now use
          "userlist-rect" so the alpha rectangle goes away when the
          list is empty.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Add information about userlist-rect id.

2006-10-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Number of usability fixes for gdmlogin.c.  Now
	  do not bother showing browser userlist widget if there are no
	  users to display.  Now OK and Cancel buttons are set sensitive or
	  insensitive based on context (OK only if something is in the entry
	  field and Cancel if not on "Username" request).  Fixed bug causing
	  face browser to autoselect first user.  I changed the behavior
	  of how key events are listened to.  Now respond on release instead
	  of press for accepting Tab key as Enter, back_prog delay,
	  timed_login reset, and flexiserver reaping.  This made setting the
	  buttons sensitive/insensitive easier.

2006-10-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	  gui/greeter/themes/*/*xml: Now support "combo" style lists and
	  support "language" and "session" lists which can be used directly
	  in the theme rather than having to use the session/language

2006-09-22  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/filecheck.c, daemon/gdm.h
	  daemon/gdmconfig.c, docs/C/gdm.xml: Now gdm.conf has
 	  SupportAutomount option which, when turned on, changes
	  the way that GDM accessess the user's $HOME/.dmrc file
	  so that automounted $HOME directories can be configured
	  to work even with the automounter isn't started with
	  the --ghost option.  This feature is off by default.

        * configure.ac: Update to new release version.

2006-09-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml, docs/es/gdm.xml, docs/uk/gdm.xml:
	  Accidently putback docs fix after freeze.  Backing
	  out.

2006-08-23  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h: Corrections to comments.

2006-08-21  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

2006-08-08  Ray Strode <rstrode@redhat.com>

	* gui/gdmwm.[ch] (gdm_wm_center_cursor): new function
	that centers mouse pointer on one head

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c (main): center cursor on main
	xinerama head on startup (looks nicer and as a side
	effect should fix bug 327530)

2006-08-07  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

        * Release 2.15.9:
        * NEWS: Updated.

2006-08-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	  from inside signal handlers, since they are not safe.  Patch
	  provided by Ray Strode <rstrode@redhat.com>.

2006-08-03  Ray Strode <rstrode@redhat.com>

	* configure.ac: look for /usr/bin/Xorg when searching for
	  X servers (bug 349836).

2006-08-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, config/gdm.conf-custom: Improved comments
	  to make gdm.conf/custom.conf more clear.

2006-08-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: Fix the setup of the iochannel so that
	  it happens after the face browser is set up.  The recent changes
	  Ray Strode made to make the message input nonblocking seemed
	  to break the Face Browser logic.  This patch makes sure that
	  the face browser is setup before setting up the iochannel.  The
	  face data is sent from the daemon to the slave along the same
	  channel, but these messages are not formatted like the other
	  messages.  Patch provided by Ray Strode <rstrode@redhat.com>.

2006-08-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix error message that gets printed when
	  you try to run GDM as non-root user.

	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c,

	  the focus management in gdmgreeter so that when using the Options
	  button the focus remains in the entry.
	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c: Only free the hash table if it
	  is not-NULL.

2006-07-31  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* NEWS: Updated with 2.14.9 and 2.14.10 info.

2006-07-31  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

        * NEWS: Updated.
        * configure.ac: Update to new release version.

2006-07-31  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmcommon.c: Fix gdm_common_setup_blinking so it doesn't
	  try to call g_signal_add_emission_hook if sid is 0.  This fixes
	  a crash in gdmchooser because we were trying to set the 
	  emission hook for a type that was not used or initialized in the
	  gdmchooser GUI.   This fixes bug #349221.
	* gui/gdmcommon.c: Set hosts_opt to NULL, otherwise processing of
	  hosts from the command line would not get done if the compiler
	  put a non-NULL value into its initial value, as it does on 
	  Solaris.

2006-07-24  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

        * Release 2.15.7:

	  error in previous patch.

2006-07-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: This patch attempts
	  to fix the problem by turning on io channel's internal
	  buffering feature, searching for the start of the next
	  message in the read in bytes and seeking backward to the
	  byte before the start of the next message.   We then
	  process only one message and return, picking up the next
	  message next iteration of the main loop.  Patch provided
	  by Ray Strode <rstrode@redhat.com>.

2006-07-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsession.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.[ch]: Fix for bug #341619.  Now
	  GDM does not save the Failsafe GNOME or Xterm session as the
	  user's default.  Cleaned up the code and moved duplicate
	  functions from gdmlogin/gdmgreeter code to gdmsession common
	  code.

2006-07-17  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

2006-06-06  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c:  Call gdmcomm_check with FALSE so that ti
	  doesn't try to pop-up a GUI.  Sometimes gdmflexiserver is called
	  by processes that do not have access to the display so this causes
	  a crash, and gdmflexiserver prints out errors anyway.
	* gui/modules/AccessDwellMouseEvents.in: Added gestures so you can
	  run the same commands as in AccessKeyMouseEvents.in with dwell
	  gestures.

	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.[ch]: Now when a user is 
	  selected and a bad password is entered, GDM remembers the

	  the userlist.  Fixes bug #342574.
	* gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.[ch]: Fix prototype
	  warning.

2006-05-22  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	  if the buttons were GTK+ style.

2006-05-19  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome-list.xml,
	  gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml: Updated theme to use real
	  GTK+ buttons.  Now says "Start Over" instead of "Cancel" on the
	  button.
	* gui/greeter/greeter_events.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.c: Code
	  cleanup.
	* docs/gdm/gdm.xml: Add docs for new features and the gtk-theme
	  greeter element feature added in 2.12 but after string-freeze, so
	  docs couldn't be updated then.

2006-04-26  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	Adding per-display configuration support to GDM.  Now if user has
	a file named /etc/gdm/custom.conf:<displaynum>, the settings in this
	file will override the /usr/share/gdm/defaults.conf and
	/etc/X11/gdm/custom.conf settings.  Only keys that affect the GUI
	behavior are supported.  These include those in the "gui" and
	"greeter" sections and the security/PamStack key.

	* daemon/gdm.c: Update GET_CONFIG command so it accepts a display
	  argument.  It is backwards compatible and will return the per-display
	  setting if this is passed in, or the non-display value if not
	  passed in.  Fix bug that caused PreFetch key to not just return
	  the once as it is supposed to.
	* daemon/gdmconfig.[ch], jui/gdmconfig.c: Updated to support
	  per-display configuration.
	* daemon/gdm.h: Updated documentation for new command.  Corrected some
	  errors.
	* daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/gdmconfig.c config/gdm.conf.in: Add
	  security/PamStack configuration variable as a per-display setting.
	  This allows the sysadmin to specify a different PAM stack, if desired
	  and also allows customization per display.  Also added key info for
	  some BackgroundProgram keys that were missing.
	* config/PreSession.in: now requests configuration data per-display.
	  Will use normal configuration if no per-display config files.
	* gui/.cvsignore: Add gdmsetup.desktop.in
	* gui/gdmdynamic.: Improve usage warning.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Add some debug
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated docs to reflect new per-display config.

2006-04-25  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml.  Add units information to TimedLoginDelay.
	  Fixes bug #334531.  Improved PAM documentation based on input
	  from Gary Winger <Gary.Winiger@sun.com>.  Added info about
	  GET_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE.  Added docs for AlwaysLoginCurrentSession
	  which I noticed were missing.

	  <vincent.fretin@gmail.com>.

2006-04-17  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c:  Fix setting of GdmHosts so it should use
	  the hosts from the config file when when BROADCAST/MULTICAST
	  is set to false.  Partial fix for #338274.  Thanks to Tiago
	  Vignatti <tv02@c3sl.ufpr.br> for noticing this.

2006-04-17  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in.in: Added.  This makes gdmsetup.desktop
	  get properly translated.  Fixes bug #334647.  Patch by Vincent
	  Fretin <vincent.fretin@gmail.com>
	* gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in: Removed
	* gui/Makefile.am: Updated to reflect change.

	* configure.ac: Update to new release version.
	
2006-04-14  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Further clean up access to ICEAuthority file.  Fixes
	  bug #338358.  Patch provided by Ray Strode <rstrode@redhat.com>.

2006-04-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* NEWS: Updated NEWS.
	* gui/gdmchooser.c: Fix references to the BROADCAST key so it is
	  correctly listed as a bool, not a string.  Kudos to Tiago Vignatti
	  <tv02@c3sl.ufpr.br>.
	* configure.ac: Fix check for adding /usr/bin to the GDM_USER_PATH so
	  it doesn't add it twice.  This used to work, but got broken on the
	  03-28-2006 patch by Julio M. Merino Vidal to get rid of the EXPANDED
	  variables.  Working again now.

2006-04-11  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/Makefile.am:  Now include gdmthemetester.in in
	  EXTRA_DIST instead of gdmthemetester.

2006-04-10  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	  <Niall.Power@sun.com>.

2006-04-07  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Now logic unlinks .ICEauthority file if it
	  looks fishy rather than trying to chown/chmod it.  This
	  is to resolve CVE-2006-1057.

2006-04-07  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/gdmconfig.c,s
	  daemon/server.c: Add new GdmXserverTimeout configuration
	  variable so the length of time that GDM waits for the
	  Xserver to start can be tuned.  This makes it easier
	  to get GDM working with some Xservers (Xgl).  Fixes
	  bug #337670.  Patch provided by Emilie (girlblossom@gmail.com).

2006-04-05  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* .cvsignore, docs/es/.cvsignore, docs/uk/.cvsignore, gui/.cvsignore,
	  m4/.cvsignore, po/.cvsignore:  Update .cvsignore files to include
	  generated files not currently listed.

2006-03-30  Dennis Cranston  <dennis_cranston@yahoo.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade:  HIG fix for spacing between the menu 
	  bar and welcome message categories.

2006-03-29  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade: Fix "Show Actions Menu" section so it
	  appears when both "plain" and "themed" is chosen.  Fixes
	  bug #335550.

2006-03-28  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmcomm.h: Fix warning.

2006-03-28  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/Xsession.in: Modify command to be "$@" instead of "$1"
	  so it is possible to pass arguments with the command.

2006-03-28  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: Removed a C99 local variable definition that
	  breaks the build with gcc 2.95 (e.g. under NetBSD 1.6).  Fixes
	  bug #336368.

2006-03-28  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* daemon/gdmconfig.c, daemon/server.c: Include sys/resource.h,
	  needed to use setpriority(2) and its associated definitions.
	  Fixes the build under NetBSD, closing bug #336369.

2006-03-28  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* Makefile.am, README.install, acconfig.h, configure.ac,
	  gdmsetup-security.in, config/Makefile.am, config/Xsession.in,
	  config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/gdm.h,

	  gui/greeter/gdmthemetester.in, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/modules/Makefile.am: Get rid of all EXPANDED_* variables from
	  the build procedure.  Directory-related variables must only be
	  expanded from the Makefiles so that they can be easily overriden
	  during the installation phase.  Fixes bug #336364.

2006-03-28  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.ac: One line change to reflect comment #7 in bug
	  #335957.

2006-03-27  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.ac, config/Makefile.am, config/PostLogin,
	  config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/gdm.[ch],
	  daemon/gdmconfig.c, gui/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/Makeifle.am,
	  gui/modules/Makefile.am, gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c,
	  gui/modules/keymouselistener.c, utils/Makefile.am: Now support
	  --with-sysconfsubdir so that GDM can be configured to have
	  the config files in a directory that isn't hardcoded to have "/gdm"
	  at the end.  Fixes bug #335957.  Patch provided by Julio M
	  Merino Vidal <jmmv@NetBSD.org> with minor changes by me to fix
	  some usage of EXPANDED_GDMCONFDIR that caused breakage on Solaris.

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmcomm.[ch],
	  gui/gdmdynamic.c, gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmphotosetup.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c:  Now use
	  gdmcomm_comm_bulk_start and gdmcomm_comm_bulk_stop to wrap areas of
	  the code where we want to keep the sockets connection open for
	  performance.  This makes gdmsetup start faster and better ensures
 	  that sockets are not left open.  Now gdmcomm_call_gdm will always
	  close the socket unless inside such a block, ensuring that if distros
	  add patches to read new config values at random points in the code,
	  the socket won't be left open.

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix gdm_debug message.

2006-03-22  Tommi Vainikainen  <thv@iki.fi>

	* configure.ac (ALL_LINGUAS): Added Dzongkha (dz).

2006-03-20  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/gnome-logo.svg,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/gnome-logo.svg,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/happygnome.xml:
	  Added new SVG official logos and now theme uses
	  the new logo.
	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/gnome-logo.png,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/gnome-logo.png:
	  Removed old logo.
	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/Makefile.am
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/Makefile.am:
	  Updated to have new logo file.  This fixes bug
	  #335121.

2006-03-20  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated version to 2.14 in docs.
	* vicious-extensions/Makefile.am: Patch to fix Makefile.am so
	  it builds test-ve-config even if the dependant glib, etc.
	  libraries are built statically on the system.  Fixes bug
	  #334934.  Patch provided by Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org>

2006-03-19  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_events.c: Fix error that causes a
	  core dump when you click on fields that have an id.
	  This should fix bug #332679.

2006-03-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Mark string "Welcome" as to be translated.  This
	  doesn't break the string freeze but with this change translators
	  can hopefully get this translated.
	* gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in: Fix TryExec to use EXPANDED_SBINDIR, so that
	  the program will run even if sbin isn't in the user's PATH.
	  
2006-03-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: One-line fix to Solaris auditing logic to
	  correct a problem that causes GDM to always fail to authenticate
	  when auditing is turned on.
	* vicious-extensions/Makefile.am: Fix reference to libvicious.a
	  so it is consistant with the other places it is referenced.

2006-03-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmcomm.h: Correct definition of gdmcomm_set_allow_sleep
	  to avoid compile warning.

2006-03-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.14.0: 
	* NEWS: Updated.
	* configure.ac: Update to 2.14.0.

2006-03-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/gdmconfig.[ch], gui/gdmcommon.[ch],
	  gui/gdmsetup.c: Add new GET_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE gdmflexiserver
	  command so gdmsetup can edit the actual custom config file
	  being used by the daemon.

2006-03-05  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item: Now open Options menu below
	  the button if possible, and above if there is no room below.
	  Previously it always showed above, which would break if the
	  button was placed on the top of the screen.
	* daemon/slave.c: Fix sound-on-login-success and failure to only
	  play if they are turned on.  Previously they were playing if
	  they were defined to have soundfiles, but not turned on.
	  Fixes bug #333435.

2006-03-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.13.0.10: 
	* NEWS: Updated.
	* configure.ac, acconfig.h: Update to 2.13.0.9.  Added code to support
	  the change in gdmconfig.c below.
	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Fix so that if gdm.conf file exists on the system
	  this is used instead of custom.conf.  This makes GDM more backwards
	  compatible and won't break user configuration if the user has an old
	  config file.  

2006-02-28  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.13.0.9: 
	* NEWS: Updated.
	* configure.ac: Update to 2.13.0.9.
	* docs/Makefile.am: Remove "uk" since there is no such
	  subdir yet.

2006-02-27  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_events.c: Small patch that I think
	  will fix core dumping problem reported in bug #332426.

2006-02-24  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Fix error message that is printed when
	  ServAuthDir isn't owned by root:gid so it says "root:gid"
	  instead of "gdm:gdm", which is wrong.  Cleaned up the 
	  code a bit.

2006-02-24  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmsetup.c: Clean up memory handling.
	
2006-02-21  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:  Add new "gtk-theme" property
	  to <greeter> tag theme xml format, so the theme can specify a
	  GtkTheme to be used for gdmgreeter.  This allows theming of
	  the "Options" menu and the entry field, and any other GTK+
	  widgets used by gdmgreeter.  This also makes it possible to
	  create a11y themes (HighContrast, LowContrast, etc.) themes
	  for gdmgreeter.

2006-02-16  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: Fix
	  face browser so it works better.  Sometimes we get PROMPT calls
	  for displaying username so we want to enable the face browser
	  in this case.  We only want to disable it when the cancel 
	  button is pressed (until the next time the daemon prompts us
	  for username/password entry).  Also fix "theme broken" message
	  so it doesn't display the message when the pam-message label is
	  in the theme.

2006-02-16  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdmconfig.c, daemon/gdm-net.c, gui/gdmsetup.c:
	  Fix some GCC C-99 compile issues.  Fixes bug #331450.
	  Patch provided by Jens Granseur <jensgr@gmx.net>.

2006-02-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Fixes to make config work better.

2006-02-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Use g_hash_table_replace instead of freeing
	  the string value in the hash.  This corrects a core dumping
	  problem with gdmsetup.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Fix issue with gdmsetup freeing theme_dir
	  when it shouldn't.  Patch provided by Matthias Clasen.
	  <Matthias.Clasen@poet.de>.
	* config/Xsession.in: Back out launching of dbus-launch after
	  discussion that is really most appropriate for this to be
	  launched by init.d scripting.

2006-02-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am, gui/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/Makefile.am, 
	  utils/gdm-dmx-reconnect-proxy.c: Reorganize libraries so that
	  it is easier to build GDM against a test Xserver.  Fixes bug
	  #331226.  Patch provided by Sylvain Bertrand
	  <sylvain.bertrand@gmail.com>.
	* daemon/slave.c: Remove some cruft accidently added.

2006-02-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/Xsession.in: Now start dbus-launch in GDM's Xsession
	  script if dbus-launch is available on the system.  Fixes
	  bug #331104.  Patch provided by delgarde@ihug.co.nz.

2006-02-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Distribute the README file.

2006-02-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.13.0.8: 
	* NEWS: Updated.
	* configure.ac: Update to 2.13.0.8 and use EXPANDED_DATADIR instead
	  of %{datadir} since that makes it work much better.
	* README.install, README, docs/C/gdm.xml:  Update docs so that the
	  change from --with-configdir to --with-defaults-conf and renaming of
	  default and custom config file is documented.
	* daemon/gdm-net.c, daemon/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmsetup.c: Update comments
	  to no longer mention old name of config file.  Fix gdmsetup to know
	  new location of custom config file.
	* config/Makefile.am: Now if upgrading and gdm.conf and
	  factory-gdm.conf are different, move the gdm.conf file to
	  custom.conf instead of copy.  This is  because we don't want GDM
	  to overwrite the custom.conf file every time user upgrades.  Only
	  first time, then gdm.conf should go away.

2006-02-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.ac, daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/gdmconfig.c,
	  docs/C/gdm.xml: Change --with-configdir to --with-defaults-conf
	  and make it work so that the gdm.conf and gdm.conf-custom file
	  can be installed to different subdirectories.  Fixes bug 
	  #330905.  Patch provided by Ray Strode.

2006-02-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/Xsession.in: Fix calls to zenity so they work.  Fixes
	  bug #330892.
	* README, README.install, docs/C/gdm.xml: Last minute updates
	  before string freeze.

2006-02-10  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c, gui/greeter/greeter_events.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:
	  Fix problem with options button and F10 menu not working if the
	  button is not in the theme.  This only affects buttons that can
	  be in the F10 button but may not be in the theme (language, 
	  system, session, halt, reboot, shutdown).  Fixes bug #330343.

2006-02-10  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* README, docs/C/gdm.xml: Few more updates worth adding.

2006-02-10  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Fix bug that was causing gdmflexiserver
	  to fail.  Because we were calling gtk-init when the --command
	  option was being used, and this breaks gdmflexiserver since it
	  is sometimes run with the --command option when there is no 
	  display.
	* README, README.install: Updated with some new features and moved some
	  info to docs/C/gdm.xml where the info is more useful.
	* TODO: Updated.
	* configure.ac: Fixed the mess about /usr/opensolaris/bin
	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: Do not put tooltips on menus.  They are
	  a bad idea and their use is discouraged by the HIG because they break
	  a11y.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated docs with a bunch of information from the 
	  README and README.install file that really belonged in the docs.

2006-02-09  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	A known issue with gdmdynamic is that when a display connects to
	the server it generates the gdmdynamic "ADD" and "RELEASE" commands.
	On startup, hundreds of displays could send these commands at once
	and cause the server too be flooded with sockets requests.  Hammering
	the socket like this caused me to find and fix a number of problems
	that improve socket reliability for general GDM use.  I also enhanced
	gdmdynamic so it is more sensitive to the socket being busy and no
	longer overloads it, instead sleeping and retrying if necessary.  This
	allows gdmdynamic to work if there are hundreds of displays instead of
	just a dozen or so.

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: Added new "SERVER_BUSY" sockets command so that
	  gdmdynamic can sleep before starting new slaves if the daemon is
	  already busy.
	* daemon/gdm-net.[ch]: Bump up MAX_CONNECTIONS from 10 to 15.  I notice
	  that this improves performance significantly when hammering the
	  daemon with connections.  Added better comments for this logic and
	  now debug logs when a subconnection is thrown away.  New
	  gdm_connection_is_server_busy function
	* daemon/display.c: Correct DYNAMIC_REMOVE so it works and fixes bug
	  #326796.  Before it wasn't really removing the displays.
	* gui/gdmdynamic.c: Quite a bit of work to make gdmdynamic avoid
	  flooding the server with sockets requests.  Now it sets sockets
	  retries to 1 and manages sleeping and retries itself.  
	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Added gdm_config_set_comm_retries so that slaves can
	  specify how many retries they want the comm logic to use.
	* gui/gdmcomm.c: Now do_command returns NULL when it gets back "",
	  which happens when a subconnection was dropped by the daemon.  This
	  lets the slave try the connection again.   Now error messages are
	  always logged, not just when debug is turned on.  Added
	  gdmcomm_did_connection_fail and gdmcomm_set_allow_sleep so 
	  gdmdynamic can control the behavior of how the connection works.
	* gui/gdmcommon.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c: Fix gdm_common_fail so it doesn't generate
	  compile errors when building with GCC.  Fixes bug #330480.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Cleaned up section that explains sockets commands so
	  that they are in alphabetical order, added info about SERVER_BUSY
	  and new gdmdynamic -s and -t options.
	* config/gdm.conf: Better description of how debug works, perhaps
	  I just didn't like the word "spew".

2006-02-07  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Return compiled in value if slave fails
	  to get a value back from the daemon.
	* gui/gdmcomm.c:, gui/gdmconfig.c:  Use gdm_common_error
	  instead of gdm_common_info so message really go to log.
	* gui/gdmsession.c: Include needed gdmcommon.h.  Missed this
	  in my previous putback earlier today.

2006-02-07  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gdm-restart.in, gdm-safe-restart.in, gdm-stop.in, gdm.spec.in:
	  Now use gdmflexiserver to get the PidFile instead of grepping the
	  config file directly since this is a safer/better way to get
	  configuration date.

2006-02-07  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	This patch resolves some performance issues that I noticed when
	testing GDM with the gdmdynamic command.  I notice that waiting for
	the sockets to timeout made gdmdynamic slower so now all the clients
	load all the configuration data in one quick pass and close the 
	socket.  Since the gdm_config_get functions cache the data, the slaves
	will not go over the socket to get the data again unless asked to
	reread.  Bump the maximum messages over the socket from 20 to 80 
	because gdmlogin pulls about 65 configuration parms over and this 
	allows all data to be accessed in one connection (and gives a little
	room for growth).  Improved the way GDM slaves deal with syslog so all
	slaves use the same interfaces.  Added three missing keys to the daemon
	configuration handling code.

	* daemon/gdmconfig.c: Add three keys that were missing for background
	  program support.
	* gui/gdmcomm.[ch]: Now if there is a failure connecting to the daemon,
	  the slave will sleep 1 second before retry (normally retries 5
	  times).  If all retries fail, it will not try sleeping on subsequent
	  calls to the daemon.  This greatly improves performance when the 
	  daemon is flooded with slave requests.  In normal usage, this will 
	  likely not happen, but it is good for GDM to not fail so easily.
	  Added better debug.  Added gdm_comm_close function so that slaves
	  can ask to close the socket when done reading config.  Now uses
	  common syslog functions.
	* daemon/gdm.h: Add better comments, rename GDM_SUP_MAX_CONNECTIONS
	  to GDM_SUP_MAX_MESSAGES which is more accurate, and bump the max
	  number to 80.
	* gui/gdmcommon.h, gui/gdmwm.h, gui/gdmsession.h: Added common syslog
	  functions to gdmcommon.h and moved some functions that were in
	  gdmcommon.h to gdmwm.h and gdmsession.h since the implementations
	  were in those c-files.  Renamed functions to make naming consistant.
	* gui/gdmXnestchooser, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmcommon.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmdynamic.c, gui/gdmflexiserver.c,
	  gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c, gui/gdmsession.c, gui/gdmwm.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c, 
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:  Slaves
	  close sockets connection when done reading config.  Now slaves use
	  common syslog functions.  Naming changes to reflect renaming of
	  functions in gdmcommon.h/gdmwm.h/gdmsession.h.  Better debug.
	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/cookie.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c,
	  daemon/gdm-net.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c,
	  gui/gdmlanguages.c, gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c,
	  gui/gdmsetup.c, vicious-extensions/ve-config.c: Make spacing around
	  "++" more consistant.  Add better debug in some functions

2006-02-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdmconfig.c: Fix glib.h include so it compiles under LFS.
	  Fixes bug #329801.

2006-02-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Add comment to docs that +xkb is needed as an
	  Xserver argument for the keyboard gestures to work.

2006-01-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Change section name for "Security" to 
	  "security" so the generated html file has a more consistant
	  name with the other html files.

2006-01-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.13.0.7: 
	* NEWS, configure.ac: Updated
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated version/date.
	* config/gdmprefetchlist.in:  Change libgstreamer-0.8 to 
	  libgstreamer-0.10 in the prefetch list.
	* docs/Makefile.am:  Adding es back to SUBDIRS.
	* docs/es/Makefile.am:  Adding file.

2006-01-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/PreSession.in:  Fix so it no longer tries to access
	  the config file via grep/sed.  Now it calls
	  'gdmflexiserver --command="GET_CONFIG"', which is a much 
	  cleaner way to get the info in needs to set the background	
	  color.

2006-01-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/options.png,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/options.png:
	  Adding back the previous sessions.png as
	  options.png since it is the best icon for the
	  new menu.

2006-01-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/disconnect.png, 
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/options.png,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/sessions.png,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/system.png,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/disconnect.png, 
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/options.png,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/sessions.png,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/system.png,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/happygnome.xml,
	  gui/greeter/themes/circles/Makefile.am,
	  gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c, 
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  docs/C/gdm.xml:  Added new "options_button" which pops up
	  the F10 menu.  Modified themes to now use the new options
	  button for a cleaner one-button look.  Patch provied by
	  Sebastien Bacher <seb128@debian.org>.  Modifications to
	  existing themes made by myself.  Also modified string
	  "Remote login via XDMCP" to "Remote Login via XDMCP".

2006-01-27  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.in: Make sure /usr/openwin/bin is in the PATH on 
	  Solaris so that GDM's PreSession/PostSession scripts can find
	  sessreg and other needed X programs.  Also this makes sure
	  that users have xterm and other such programs in their PATH.
	  Before we were only adding it if the Xserver was Xsun, but
	  it is also needed if using the Xorg Xserver on Solaris.

2006-01-27  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmcommon.c:  Add better
	  logic for grabbing the time for the user's locale if 
	  Use24HourClock is set to auto.  No longer depend on translaters
	  providing a hacky translation of "24-hour" to determine this.
	  Instead just rely on localtime.  Fixes bug #328904.  Patch
	  provided by Christopher Aillon <caillon@gmail.com>.
	* config/gdm.conf.in: Add better comments for certain keys and
	  group them so that similar keys are closer together.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: rename
	  GDM_KEY_GRAPHICAL_THEME_COLOR to GDM_KEY_GRAPHICAL_THEMED_COLOR to
	  match the key.

2006-01-27  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: Change "XDMCP Chooser" to 
	  "Remote login via XDMCP".  Fixing bug #328857.

2006-01-24  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/gdmprefetchlist.in:  Updated with version provided by
	  Padraig O'Briain.  Remove libnautilus-private as it no longer
	  exists in GNOME 2.13.

2006-01-23  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Add Troubleshooting section.

2006-01-20  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/fstype.c: Really fix bug #326819.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml:  Better scrollkeeper/yelp description for GDM.  Fixes
	  bug #327796.  Patch by Alessandro Ferrucci <a24@umbc.edu>.

2006-01-19  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.13.0.6: 
	* NEWS, configure.ac: Updated
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated version/date.

2006-01-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* MAINTAINERS: Updated.

2006-01-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	  vicious-extensions/ve-signal.c:  Add needed glib/gstdio.h include
	  to daemon/fstype.c which fixes a wierd core dumping problem on
	  Ubuntu.  Fixes bug #326819.  Patch provided by Sebastien Bacher
	  <seb128@debian.org>.  Also fixed all the source so that the includes
	  are more consistant with config.h in quotes instead of in "<>" and
	  glib/gtk includes are always listed after system includes.

2006-01-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: Use "reboot" instead of "restart".  Fixes
	  bug #327583.

2006-01-17  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Added docs for "secure remote" feature.  Patch
	  provided by Dominique Hazael-Massieux.

2006-01-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.13.0.5: 
	* NEWS, configure.ac: Updated
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated version/date.
	* utils/Makefile.am: Fix Makefile so "make clean" doesn't delete
	  gdm-ssh-session.

2006-01-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Fix the logo and background file choosers so that
	  they no longer generate assert warnings.  This problem seemed to be
	  related to the fact that gdmsetup was sometimes setting the logo or
	  background to NULL without the user actually changing the values.
	  Now the "selection-changed" handler is smart enough to never reset
	  these value to NULL.  Also cleaned up some memory management (e.g. we
	  were not freeing values returned from gtk_file_chooser_get_filename,
	  etc.)
	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Use the newkey instead of key when calling
	  GET_CONFIG.

2006-01-14  Chao-Hsiung Liao  <j_h_liau@yahoo.com.tw>

	* configure.in: Add "zh_HK" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2006-01-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Patch provided by Dan Walsh <dwalsh@redhat.com> to
	  fix SELinux logic so that GDM doesn't setexeccon if
	  is_selinux_enabled returns -1.  In this case, the issue is logged to
	  syslog.

2006-01-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	Enhancement patch provided by Dominique Hazael-Massieux 
	<dominique.hazael-massieux@centraliens.net> with some help from me
	getting the configure/Makefile stuff working.

	* configure.ac, config/Makefile.am, docs/C/gdm.xml, utils/Makefile.am:
	  Add support for --enable-secureremote
	* config/ssh.desktop.in, utils/gdm-ssh-session: Added desktop file
	  and gdm-ssh-session script to support secure remote login.

2006-01-11  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c,
	  docs/C/gdm.xml, gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:  Change the
	  "Please make sure the Caps Lock key is not enabled." message to
	  the more informational "Caps Lock is on.".  Some users may want to
	  use Caps Lock when logging in.

2006-01-11  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c, docs/C/gdm.xml: Use
	  "Shut Down" instead of "Shut down" or "shut down".

2006-01-11  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, docs/C/gdm.xml, gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:: Rename
	  "shutdown" to "shut down" or "halt" and rename "capslock" to 
	  "Caps Lock" since these are the recommended wordings suggested by
	  Calum Benson.  Also corrected a few errors in the stock labels.

2006-01-11  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c:  Now use GDK_DISPLAY_XDISPLAY instead of
	  GDK_DISPLAY since the GDK_DISPLAY macro causes the GDM daemon to
	  require the gdk_display extern global variable from the libgdk-x11
	  library and always causes this library to get loaded into memory even
	  though normally the GDM daemon does not make calls to GDK.  Using
	  GDK_DISPLAY_XDISPLAY makes lazy loading work better.  Thanks to 
	  Padraig O'Briain for noticing this issue.

2006-01-09  Dennis Cranston  <dennis_cranston@yahoo.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: (theme_list_equal_func): New function.
	(setup_local_themed_settings), (setup_remote_themed_settings):
	Group the preview and markup into one column.  Sort list
	and setup a GTK+ TreeView search function.
	* gui/gdmsetup.glade:  Fix a few broken mnemonics.  Enable 
	GTK+ TreeView searches. 

2006-01-09  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/locale.alias:  Correct spelling of "Esperanto".
	  Fixes bug #326350.  Patch provided by Saleem Abdulrasool
	  <compnerd@gentoo.org>.

2006-01-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Added "Performance" section to discuss 
	  the --with-prefetch option.

2006-01-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/Makefile.am:  Make the Makefile.am file a bit smarter.

2006-01-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Make error message more clear when session file
	  is invalid.  Now it says what session file had the problem.
	  This fixes bug #322699.
	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Now the gdm_config_get_xserver_details
	  function is more robust, and handles NULL return values 
	  better and supports PRIORITY.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Now that gdmconfig reads in the priority value,
	  gdmsetup will write it back out if that server is modified.
	  However, gdmsetup still doesn't allow you to modify the
	  priority value.  Probably should add a spinbutton to the
	  dialog.

2006-01-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.ac, gui/gdmsetup.c, vicious-extensions/Makefile.am: No
	  longer require libgnome or libgnomeui at all in GDM2.  Patch
	  provided by Jani Monoses <jani.monoses@gmail.com>.

2006-01-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.ac, docs/C/gdm.xml, config/gdm.conf.in: Fix 
	  Prefetch command so that there is a needed "@" before the
	  argument to gdmprefetch.  Padraid O'Briain pointed out this
	  oversight.  Made docs a bit more clear to highlight the usage
	  of this "@" character.
	* gui/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: Now call gdm_working_command_exists
	  for halt/reboot/suspend/configurator once at startup and cache 
	  the values in globals so we don't have to keep calling this 
	  function over and over while gdmgreeter runs.  Padraig noticed
	  that this function causes a large number of calls to stat which
	  are easily avoided by caching.

2006-01-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c:  Fix problem where gdmsetup does not remember
	  that Automatic Login checkbox has been changed.  Fixes bug
	  #325910.

2006-01-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	The PreFetch part of this patch was provided by Padraig O'Briain
	with some modifications by myself to better integrate into the
	configure/Makefile build.   The rest of this work was done by
	myself.

	* gui/gdmcommon.c: Fix problem with client not properly counting
	  the number of connections, and make logic more robust so when
	  it receives an "ERROR 200 Too many messages" it will close and
	  reopen the connection and try again rather than just fail.
	  This fixes bug #325756.
	* configure.ac, configure/Makefile.am: Add loginpreloadlist
	* utils/prefetch.c: Now handle comments that start with "#" in
	  the preloadlist file.
	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/gdmconfig.c, config/gdm.conf, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmcommon.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter.c: Now PostDisplayProgram is
	  PreFetchProgram.  Fixed some comments in gdm.h.
	* daemon/gdm.c: Now KEY_PRE_FETCH_PROGRAM is only returned to the
	  first slave that asks for the value, ensuring the prefetch only
	  happens the first time a greeter is displayed.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Rewrote the Introduction section so it is more
	  clear, made improvements to the Accessibility section, and fixed
	  a number of formatting issues.  Now a separate Security section.
	  Updated docs to reflect PreFetchProgram change.
	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Clean up the code a little.

2006-01-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.ac:  Update glib required to 2.8 since we now use g_access. 

2006-01-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.13.0.4: 
	* NEWS, configure.ac: Updated
	* config/Makefile.am: Corrected make distcheck issue.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated version/date.

2005-12-24  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: Now set greeter_probably_login_prompt to
	  FALSE if we get a Password request as a GDM_NOECHO message.  This
	  makes GDM smarter about when it is at the Username prompt and
	  fixes bug #320738, which was causing GDM to just login as the
	  timed user when the password was requested - which it should not
	  do.  It should only log in immediately as the timed user if ENTER
	  is hit from the login screen without actually typing in a username.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Removed some syslog debug messages I accidently
	  left there.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Now mention that if the user hits just ENTER
	  when TimedLoginEnable is on, that GDM will just login immediately
	  as the timed user.  This is how GDM has always behaved, just was
	  not documented.
	* gui/greeter/greeter_session.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:
	  Removed syslog.h include since it isn't used in these files.
	* daemon/server.c: Fixed comments.
	* daemon/slave.c: Fixed comments.

2005-12-24  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	Happy holidays.  Some bug fixes.

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/gdmconfig.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_timed.c:
	  Fix so that timed/automatic enable is checked and 
	  automatic/timed login is only turned on if they are
	  enabled.  Fix so greeters restart if timed login is
	  Changed in gdmsetup.  Fixes bug #324337.
	* gui/gdmcommon.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item.c, gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:
	  Now gdmlogin and gdmcommon use the same character sequences
	  with Welcome/RemoteWelcome messages.  Fixes bug #322711.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Document how character sequences work with text
	  labels and Welcome/RemoteWelcome messages.
	* gui/gdmcommon.[ch], gui/gdmchooser.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c, gui/greeter/greeter_geometry.c:
	  Rename functions so all common functions have prefix gdm_common.

2005-12-22  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/errorgui.c,
	  daemon/filecheck.c, daemon/fstype.c, daemon/gdm-net.c,
	  daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/gdmconfig.c, daemon/misc.c,

	  vicious-extensions/ve-config.c, vicious-extensions/ve-gnome.c,
	  vicious-extensions/ve-misc.[ch], vicious-extensions/ve-nongnome.c:
	  Now use g_ stdio function like g_chmod instead of chmod.
	  Fixes bug #310299.

2005-12-21  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	Patch by Padraig O'Briain <Padraig.OBriain@sun.com>, modified by myself
	so it also works with gdmlogin and not just gdmgreeter.  Also I
	integrated his gdmprefetch.c utility into the configure/Makefile system
	with the --with-prefetch option.

	* configure.ac:  Now support --with-prefetch
	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/gdmconfig.c, config/gdm.conf.in:  Support
	  new PostDisplayProgram key.
	* gui/gdmcommon.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c:  Now
	  support new PostDisplayProgram key.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Add docs for new key.
	* utils/Makefile.am, utils/gdmprefetch.c: Add new
	  gdmprefetch utility.
	* config/Makefile.am: Now install gdm.conf file with 444
	  permissions and always write over the installed gdm.conf 
	  after first moving aside the user's gdm.conf file if
	  necessary.

2005-12-21  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	After two months, the redesign of GDM's internal configuration is
	finally reaching a close.  Now GDM users are instructed to not modify
	the gdm.conf file directly and instead put any cutomizations in a
	separate file called gdm.conf-custom (read the comments in both files).
	gdmsetup now modifies the gdm.conf-custom file.  The GDM daemon will
	now use values in gdm.conf-custom first and the default values in
	gdm.conf if no value is defined in gdm.conf-custom.  Benefits:

	1) Now GDM truly supports system-wide and machine-specific config.
	   System wide configuration is when the sysadmin wants to share the
	   main gdm.conf file across multiple systems on a shared file system
	   (possible by building GDM with the --with-configdir option or by
	   running GDM with the --config option).  Specific systems can
	   override defaults by modifying the gdm.conf-custom file.
	2) Distros can stomp the main gdm.conf file on upgrade knowing that any
	   user changes are stored in a separate file.  For best backwards
	   compatibility, distros will need to move the gdm.conf file to
	   gdm.conf-custom if the gdm.conf file exists on the system but the
	   gdm.conf-custom file does not.
	3) Making this work required a lot of cleanup in the way GDM manages
	   its configuration files.  For example, now config options are
	   managed via access functions, and do not depend on non-static
	   globals being shared across files.  The GET_CONFIG and UPDATE_CONFIG
	   commands work better and do not require special tweaking when adding
	   new config options.  Vicious-extensions is now only included in a
	   few files that need to know how to access the config files directly.

	This makes GDM support a popular feature in CDE which works similarly.
	(config files in /etc/dt/config take precidence over the ones in
	/usr/dt/config).

	* daemon/gdmconfig.[ch]: Now supports reading configuration values
	  (including "servers" and "server-foo" sections from gdm.conf-custom
	  and then from gdm.conf if not found in the custom file.  Now store
	  translated strings in a separate hash since this improves
	  performance.  Fix GET_SERVER_DETAILS so it works better and
	  update config can now update server-foo sections via the
	  "xservers/PARMAETERS" key.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Now only writes to the gdm.conf-custom file and is
	  smart enough to just delete the key if the value will be the same as
	  in the gdm.conf file.  Fixed some core dumping issues caused by my
	  change to make gdmsetup use the new gdmconfig functions for getting
	  configuration data from the server.  This work cleaned up the code
	  quite a bit.  Removed the "--config" option from gdmsetup since this
	  change makes it edit the configuration of the running GDM daemon
	  instead of a program that edits a particular configuration file.
	* daemon/gdm.h, doc/C/gdm.xml: Updated docs with info about how
	  configuration works nwo.  Now sockets protocol info is the same
	  in both documents.
	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix GET_SERVER_DETAILS to support "ID" and some
	  cleanup.
	* gui/Makefile.am, daemon/Makefile.am: Support --with-configdir option
	  which got broken.
	* config/gdm.conf.in: Updated comments to mention that this file is not
	  to be edited.	Cleaned up the file so it is more readible.
	* config/Makefile.am: Install gdm.conf-custom and move gdm.conf to
	  gdm.conf-custom if it is modified and gdm.conf-custom is not already
	  installed.  If it is changed and gdm.conf-custom already exists, move
	  it to gdm.conf.org.
	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Remove unused getting of the
	  configuration file.
	* gui/gdmconfig.[ch]: Add function to tell config to never_cache, which
	  is needed by gdmsetup.
	* config/gdm.conf-custom: Added template file.

2005-12-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Fix bug I introduced into gdmsetup when I made it
	  use the new gdmconfig functions.  Still need to use ve_config
	  functions when accessing the server-foo sections.  Patch provided by 
	  Jani Monoses <jani.monoses@gmail.com>.

2005-12-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am: Fix Makefile so that libviciousui.a is used instead
	  of libviciousui-gnome.a.  This allows all GDM GUI programs to not
	  require libgnome anymore.  Only gdmsetup still requires libgnomeui.

2005-12-12  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemongdmconfig.[ch]: Add GET_SERVER_LIST and

	  using the sockets protocol.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Add docs for new sockets commands.

2005-11-21  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	This further improves GDM configuration so that now only the GDM
	daemon parses and manages the configuration file.  Most client
	programs use the GET_CONFIG command to access needed data.  This
	simplifies the configuration logic and puts all configuration parsing
	in one place and gets rid of a lot of global variables that were
	making the code look messy.  This also gets rid of several places
	where gnome_config deprecated functions were being used.  I have
	cleaned up the code so that the vicious-extensions code is more
	localized in gui/gdmconfig.[ch].  Some work is left to do:
	gdmflexiserver still uses gnome_config functions and gdmconfig should
	use the new functions for reading from the configuration file.  Some
	compile issues fixed as highlghted by dmacks@netspace.org to fix
	bug #322083.

	* NEWS: Fixed comment.
	* daemon/gdm.h: Further cleanup of #define's so that they better match
	  the names of the config keys.
	* daemon/gdm.c: Now GET_CONFIG returns "OK" if the key is valid but has
	  no value when it is a string.  Now free return value from
	  gdm_config_to_string.
	* daemon/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/Makefile.am: Now the daemon validates
	  the greeter's theme directory, so pass the default value into the
	  daemon and not the greeter.
	* daemon/gdmconfig.h: Added gdm_is_valid_key and corrected prototype
	  for gdm_set_user_session_lang.
	* daemon/slave.c: Fix warning and compile errors.
	* daemon/gdmconfig.c: Further fleshed out.  Now it supports a few
	  additional keys I overlooked.  It now validates all keys used by the
	  slaves.  Now handles translated string.  Further refactored the code.
	* gui/Makefile.am: Added gdmconfig.[ch] to common library.
	* gui/gdmconfig.[ch]: New functions for accessing configuration data
 	  for slaves.
	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmlanguages.c,

	* gui/gdmcomm.c: Fix gdm_check_comm to no longer require passing in
	  the config file name.
	* gui/gdmcommon.[ch]: Get rid of old gdm_common_*_same functions that
	  are replaced with new gui/gdmconfig logic.  Now functions that access
	  config data use the new functions.
	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Now displays the localized string when you use
	  GET_CONFIG to access a translatable string.
	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Now calls update_key in addition to update_greeters
	  when updating greeter config data, since the daemon needs to update
	  the values now when they change.

2005-11-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	Redesign of daemon configuraton.  Now all vicious-extensions logic is
	in gdmconfig.[ch].  This greatly simplifies how the UPDATE_CONFIG, and
	GET_CONFIG commands work and makes it easier to update the way GDM
	handles configuration.  Changed ve_setenv/ve_unsetenv to
	g_setenv/g_unsetenv since GDM requires a newer version of GLIB than
	could possibly cause the old ve versions to get used.

	* daemon/gdmconfig.[ch]: New logic for interacting with
	  vicious-extensions.
	* daemon/gdm.h: Updated comments and changed the #define for many
	  configuration options so the naming is more consistant.  Now the
	  #defines more closely match the keys in gdm.conf and more
	  consistantly use the underscore.

	  Now include gdmconfig.h instead of vicious.h and changed "Gnome" to
	  "GNOME" in comment.
	* daemon/Makefile.am: Added new gdmconfig.[ch]
	* gui/gdmXnestChooser.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmcomm.c,

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade:  Implement the new UI.
	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: (main):  Get the background color from
	  GDM_KEY_GRAPHICAL_THEME_COLOR, but fallback to GDM_KEY_BACKGROUNDCOLOR
	  if its does not exist.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c: (gdm_login_parse_config), (setup_background),
	  (gdm_reread_config): Fix bugs found in the parsing of the welcome

	  GDM_KEY_CHOOSER_BUTTON_LOGO keys.
	* daemon/gdm.c: (gdm_handle_user_message): Add newly defined keys.
	* daemon/slave.c: (session_child_run):  Pass a GDM_GREETER_TYPE
	  environmental variable to presession script.
	* config/PreSession.in:  Add support for plain and background color.

2005-10-28  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/display.c: If the slave doesn't respond to a SIGTERM, try
	  SIGKILL the second time.  GDM has a problem where it will sometimes
	  stop managing a display because it just keeps waiting for a slave to
	  die after sending it a SIGTERM.  Some users have found that this
	  patch works around the problem of a child ignoring SIGTERM.  Patch
	  provided by Vaclav Smilauer <eudoxos@arcig.cz>.  Fixes bug #113902.

2005-10-28  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_capslock.c: Patch to make GDM warn correctly
	  about caps lock if an alternative keymap is enabled.  Now use
	  kbGetState instead of XkbGetIndicatorState.  Fixes bug #317732.
	  Patch provided by Michael Hofmann <mh21@piware.de>.

2005-10-28  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	* configure.ac: Check for X server in prefix /usr

2005-10-27  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Fix race condition where the d variable wasn't being
	  set until after the signal handlers, and the signal handlers make use
	  of this variable.  Now set it before to ensure it is set whenever a
	  signal might be received.  Issue pointed out by Simon Bowden on
	  gdm-list@gnome.org

2005-10-27  Erdal Ronahi  <erdal.ronahi@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Added ku (Kurdish) to ALL_LINGUAS

2005-10-26  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.13.0.0:  Bumping minor version to match GNOME release
	  schedule.
	* NEWS, configure.ac, autogen.sh: Updated.  Renamed configure.in to
	  configure.ac.  
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated to include more workaround info for
	  accessibility.

2005-10-14  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: No longer set tooltips for menu items in gdmlogin.
	  These are distracting, and do not work with accessibility.  After
	  talking with Owen Taylor at the GNOME Boston Summit, he said no GNOME
	  programs do this, and it is not recommended.  Fix for bug #144869.
	* gui/gdmchooser.c:  Now use gdm_common_setup_cursor instead of its own
	  copy of the same function.
	* gui/gdmcommon.[ch]: gdmlogin, gdmgreeter and gdmchooser were all
	  using their own functions to set the background color.  Now they use
	  a common function in gdmcommon.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: Now sets
	  background color and sets cursor to a watch as soon as GTK is
	  initialized and the configure file read.  This shortens the amount of
	  time the background is Xserver default gray.

2005-10-06  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Add some information about using GlobalFaceDir when
	  home directories are mounted via NFS/NIS, etc.

2005-10-06  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c:  Change the way the "OK" and "Cancel"
	  buttons work so that they are consistant.  Now the "Cancel" button in
	  gdmlogin is active when the Username is requested and pressing it
	  just clears the field.  This makes gdmlogin work like gdmgreeter.
	  This is easier than changing gdmgreeter because the greeter themes
	  don't support changing buttons sensitivity.  Also it is somewhat
	  useful for Cancel to work this way.  Now make the buttons insensitive
	  when ok/enter/tab is pressed and make them sensitive again when the
	  greeter wants entry.  This fixes bug #318017 where users could
	  corrupt gdmgreeter's memory by hitting cancel after authentication
	  (which would only happen if the PostLogin script caused a long enough
	  delay to allow this (or perhaps on a real slow machine).
	  
2005-10-06  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Fix problem with PostSession script not always
	  getting executed when user kills the Xserver with ctl-alt-backspace.  
	  This is caused because an xioerror is generated by whack clients and
	  this xioerror needs to be ignored for PostSession to be processed.
	  This problem tended not to manifest in GDM 2.6 because the
	  introduction of the whack clients call made the xioerror get
	  generated earlier.  However, it was still a race condition and this
	  fix ensures that the xioerror will not cause the slave to ever exit
	  too early.  Fixes bug #152906.  Patch provided by Jerry G. DeLapp
	  <jgd@lanl.gov>
	* AUTHORS: Update file.

2005-10-05  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, config/gdm.conf.in,
	  daemon/gdm.h, Define SoundProgram to be /usr/bin/audioplay instead of
	  /usr/bin/play on Solaris.  /usr/bin/play doesn't exist on Solaris.

2005-10-04  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Correct reading of config file.  Fixes bug
	  #313701.  Patch provided by Christiaan Welvaart
 	  <cjw@daneel.dyndns.org>.

2005-09-28  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c (is_program_in_path, maybe_lock_screen)
	(run_logged_in_dialogue, main): Consolidate screensaver activation
	code.  Don't use deprecated gnome-exec.  Fixes #311497.

2005-09-27  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: Now print syslog warning if GDM
	  theme has ulist but does not have pam-message.

2005-09-26  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c:  Only set right/left mouse
	  buttons to map to button1 when RUNNING_UNDER_GDM and now show hidden

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Cleaned up startnew option.
	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c, gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c:
	  Remove needless include.

2005-09-22  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c (run_again): use gnome-screensaver if
	  available instead of xscreensaver.

2005-09-22  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: fixed compilation warnings.
	  (add_preview_widget): made it static to avoid 'no previous prototype'
	  warning.
	  (browse_button_cb, fill_model): removed unused variables.

2005-09-20  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* README.install, pam_allow.c: Add documentation regarding how to set
	  up Automatic Login on Solaris.
	* daemon/Makefile.am, gui/Makefile.am, 
	  gui/greeter/Makefile.am, gui/modules/Makefile.am,
	  vicious-extensions/Makefile.am:  Remove illegal reference to build
	  directory in installed .la files.  Fixes bug #316793, patch provided
	  by Stanislav Brabec <sbrabec@suse.cz>.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Fix comment for translators to make it more clear
	  that %l is a strftime option for 12 hour format.  Fixes bug #316773.
	  
2005-09-14  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c:  Made error message about dmrc file being ignored
	  more clear.  Fixes bug #316242.

2005-09-14  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: (gdm_xdmcp_decode_packet):
	 Make XdmcpFill() failure a debug, as it also happens when the client
	 disconnects from the XDMCP server before the session was setup
	 (Closes: #316316)

2005-09-14  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in:  Added debug/gestures key so that you can turn on
	  debugging for the gesture listeners separately from general debug.
	  Gesture listener debug output is too verbose to include in general
	  debug.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Docs had very little information about debug, so
	  added info.

2005-09-14  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Fix gdmsetup so that when user modifies
	  Include/Exclude list, it also updates automatic/timed login dropdown
	  immediately.
	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c: Remove incorrect comment.

2005-09-13  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c,
	  gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:  Now turn on gesture debug when GDM
	  debug is on.  Fix bug in dwellmouselistener that was causing
	  gestures to not be recognized.

2005-09-06  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c,

	  utils/gdm-dmx-reconnect-proxy.c,
	  vicious-extensions/vc-misc.c:  Correct memory leaks.  Fixes bug
	  #315388, patch by Steve Grubb with minor tweaks by myself.
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Corrected definition of void function to avoid
	  compiler warning.

2005-09-06  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.8.0.4.
	* configure.in, NEWS: Updated.

2005-08-30  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c, gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c:
	  Fixed syslog debugging so it works better.

	GNOME HIG fixes for the Language, Session and Message dialogs.
	Modified the ve_hig_dialog_new() function to use
	gtk_message_dialog_new() now that it supports both primary and
	secondary text.  Changed the shutdown, reboot, and suspend

2005-08-22  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* gui/gdmwm.c: added missing includes for clean 64 bit compilation.

2005-08-22  Tommi Vainikainen  <thv@iki.fi>

	* README: Fixed address of the web site.

2005-08-20  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.8.0.3.
	* configure.in, NEWS: Updated.

2005-08-20  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c: Honor Default Session gdm.conf setting
	  when using autologin.  Fixes bug #313996.  Patch by HansPetter
	  Jansson <hpj@novell.com>

2005-08-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Fix reading of configuration file so it works.

2005-08-18  Frederic Crozat  <fcrozat@mandriva.com>

	* config/locale.alias: Remove spaces in locale name, it causes gdm to
	  discard those locales. No string freeze was broken, these strings
	  are not displayed.  Fix bug #313735.

2005-08-17  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c (greeter_system_handler): added
	  missing tooltips.

2005-08-16  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* README: Add info about the gdm-list@gnome.org and location of
	  archives.

2005-08-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am:  Change installation location of
	  gdmphotosetup.desktop from /usr/share/gnome/capplets to
	  /usr/share/applications since the older directory is deprecated since
	  GNOME 2.10 and is not menu-spec compliant.  Fixes bug #313205.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated Face Browser docs to better explain how
	  things work now that bug #310906 has been fixed, and to clarify that
	  the Face Browser can be used with the Themed Greeter.

2005-08-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* README.install, config/gdm.conf.in, docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated links to
	  point to the new http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/ for the project
	  page.  Updated Commands section of the docs so they look better.
	  Fixed art.gnome.org link.
	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Fix bug #313197.
	* gui/gdm.conf.in: Added docs to better explain how
	  AlwaysRestartServer works.

2005-08-12  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* AUTHORS: Updated.

2005-08-11  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* NEWS: updated to be a bit more clear.
	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-pam.c: Now support
	  Solaris SDTLOGIN mechanism which will cause the Xserver to be started
	  as the user instead of as root for extra security.
	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Add a new option --startnew (or -s) to start a
	  new flexible server without displaying a dialog asking the user if
	  they wish to continue an existing session.  This is useful for
	  starting gdmflexiserver from the screensaver where the user cannot
	  respond to a dialog.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml:  Updated gdmflexiserver docs so they are more clear
	  and added info about the SDTLOGIN mechanism.  Add info about new
	  gdmflexiserver option.

2005-08-09  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsession.c: Correct use-after-free issue with the dynamic
	  session in the sessions list.  Patch by Joe Marcus Clarke, fixes bug
	  #312974.

2005-08-08  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* NEWS: Updated for 2.8.0.2 release.
	* gui/gdmsetup.glade:  Fixed strings, refer to bugs #312956, 312959,
	  and 312960.
	* daemon/gdm.c: Fixed Multicast compile issue when IPv6 is not set.
	* configure.in, config/Makefile.am: Fixed "make distcheck" issue.

2005-08-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/server.c: Fix malformed string.
	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/gdm.h: Fixed GET_CONFIG command so it works.
	  Before it only printed out the value if it had a value defined in the
	  gdm.conf file.  Now it prints out the runtime value.  For values that
	  are only used by other programs, it prints out the compiled-in
	  default if no value exists in gdm.conf.  Added comments to gdm.h to
	  make it clear what work developers should do when adding new
	  configuration options.
	* gui/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in: Fixed default value for GtkRC so it's
	  %datadir%/themes/Default/gtk-2.0/gtkrc instead of Default/gtk/gtkrc.

2005-08-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Made XML conformant.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c:  Now GDM is more backwards
	  compatible.  The change to add DefaultWelcome and
	  DefaultRemoteWelcome to the config file would cause old configuration
	  files to ignore the setting.  Now if the gdm.conf file is missing the
	  DefaultWelcome or DefaultRemoteWelcome key it goes ahead and uses the
	  message in gdm.conf (unless the message is the same as the default
	  anyway).

2005-08-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.in: Correct AT_BINDIR.
	* daemon/gdm.h: Changed "xdmcp" to "XDMCP" in comments.

2005-08-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], gui/gdmsetup.c : Change GDM_KEY_SERVERS to
	  GDM_KEY_SECTION_SERVER and added GDM_KEY_SECTION_GREETER.  There
	  already is a GDM_KEY_GREETER, so for section #defines it's better to
	  include "SECTION" in it.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade:  Made a number of UI
	  improvements.  Calum Benson is doing a UI review of gdmsetup and I
	  made the following fixes based on his recommendations.  No longer
	  have mnemonics on the tabs since this is against HIG rules, changes
	  "Face Browser" tab to "Users" since the Include/Exclude list really
	  also affects Automatic/Timed login and not just the Face Browser.
 	  Added label to the Users tab to explain what the tab does, since it
	  wasn't too clear before.  Improved description of "Disallow TCP
	  connections" on the security tab so it is more clear what this does
	  (and highlight it doesn't affect XDMCP).  I also fixed the
	  sensitivities when "Include All Users" is checked.  Previously it
	  was making both the Include and Exclude list insensitive - it really
	  should just make the Include list and buttons to move between
	  Incude/Exclude insensitive.  This is now working.
	
2005-08-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/verify-pam.c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in, docs/C/gdm.xml, config/Makefile.am,
	  daemon/Makefile.am: Provide better support for /etc/default/login.
	  Previously it supported only PASSREQ.  Now it supports PATH, SUPATH,
	  and CONSOLE.  Added new PasswordRequired gdm.conf setting to control
	  whether NULL_PASSWORDS are allowed when using PAM.
	* config/gdm.conf.in: Changed default for AllowRemoteRoot to false and
	  ConfigAvailable.  This makes GDM more secure by default.  Some
	  distros may want to change the default back to true.  If people
	  complain about this change, I'll make it possible to set these via
	  the configure script.

2005-08-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/gdm.c,
	  Change to the way the patch introduced on 07/22 works.  Now GDM
	  continues to install the default gdm.conf file in %sysconfdir%/gdm
	  unless the user runs configure with the --with-configdir option.
	  The daemon will now first look in this location and then look in the
	  %sysconfdir%/gdm directory for the config file.  This allows GDM to
	  better support system-wide configuration, but leaves the config file
	  in %sysconfdir% for systems that do not need this feature.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated docs.
	* README.install: Updated text to include information about
	  HaltCommand and RebootCommand.
 
2005-08-01  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	* gui/gdmwm.c (gdm_common_query): Reorder code so that the 
	affirmative response is always the rightmost button in a dialog
	as per the HIG. (Bug #312188)

2005-07-31  Tommi Vainikainen  <thv@iki.fi>

	* m4/.cvsignore: Added.
	* docs/ChangeLog: Started new ChangeLog similar to po/ChangeLog
	after gnome-doc-utils migration.
	* configure.in, Makefile.am: gnome-doc-utils migration
	* .cvsignore: Added gnome-doc-utils.make

2005-07-26  Tommi Vainikainen  <thv@iki.fi>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c (setup_gui), gui/gdmsetup.glade: Removed special
	option for 24 hour time format.
	* gui/gdmcommon.h, gui/gdmcommon.c
	(gdm_common_select_time_format): Added function to parse between
	"auto", "true", and "false" in "Use24Clock" setting.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_login_parse_config), gui/greeter/greeter.c
	(greeter_parse_config): Use gdm_common_select_time_format(...).
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Documented new default "auto" option for
	Use24Clock, which selects 24 hour time format by locale
	(translation). Fixes bug #145549.

2005-07-25  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/Makefile.am:  Now installs gdm.conf to /usr/share/gdm.  Fixed
	  "make distcheck".

2005-07-25  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* .cvsignore: Added depcomp and stamp-h1
	* daemon/slave.c (ask_migrate) 
	(gdm_slave_check_user_wants_to_log_in):
	* daemon/gdm.[ch] (gdm_config_parse): 
	* config/gdm.conf.in: Add a configuration option
	  AlwaysLoginCurrentSession that will automatically switch the user
	  back to their previous session without asking.  This is off by
	  default for now.  Fixes bug #311415.

2005-07-25  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/gdmcommon.c (gdm_common_get_config_file): Don't return a pointer
	  into the middle of a string that must be freed.  Fixes bug #311499.
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c (main): Free config file string again.

2005-07-25  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix build by only using GDM_KEY_MULTICAST when IPV6 is
	  enabled.

2005-07-25  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/faces/butterfly.png: Somehow missed adding this file.
	* gui/faces/.cvsignore: Add file.

2005-07-24  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c (check_for_displays) 
	(greeter_generate_userlist, greeter_populate_user_list):
	A few more tweaks to the face browser.

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c (maybe_migrate_old_config): Fix leak.
	(main): Freeing result of gdm_common_get_config file
	causes memory corruption.  So, don't free it until
	we find the problem.

2005-07-24  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/faces/Makefile.am:
	* gui/face/dice.jpg:
	* gui/face/sky.jpg: Updated images.

	* gui/face/astronaut.jpg:
	* gui/face/baseball.png:
	* gui/face/butterfly.png:

	* gui/face/daisy.jpg: Removed.
	
2005-07-22  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version to 2.8.0.2 since
	  a new interface was added, the gdmflexiserver
	  command, GET_CONFIG_FILE was added.
	* daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/gdm.[ch], 
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, docs/C/gdm.xml,
	  gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, 
	  gui/gdmchooser.c, gdm/gdmcomm.[ch], 
	  gui/gdmcommon.[ch], gdm/gdmdynamic.c, 
	  gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, 
	  gui/gdmphotosetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.c, 
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c:  If /etc/gdm/gdm.conf does not exist, then GDM
	  will look in /usr/share/gdm/gdm.conf.  Since /usr/share can be shared
	  across multiple systems, this makes it easier for sysadmins to
	  configure sitewide settings for GDM2 instead of having to customize
	  /etc/gdm/gdm.conf on all the machines separately.  Now GDM installs
	  the gdm.conf and factory-gdm.conf files in the /usr/share/gdm
	  location.  The gdm daemon needs to be restarted to use a different
	  configuration file.  All applications that use the config file now
	  use the new GET_CONFIG_FILE gdmflexiserver command to get the
	  configuration file to use.  This way the applications don't get
	  confused if, say, the sysadmin creates an /etc/gdm/gdm.conf file
	  after the server was started using one in /usr/share/gdm.  Both the
	  gdm daemon and gdmsetup now allow a --config option so the sysadmin
	  can specify their own location for the config file.  

	  Moved GdmMulticast and GdmMulticastAddr to gdm.c so we don't access
	  the config file a second time in xdmcp.c.  Corrected grammar for some
	  messages.  Changed g_access() to access() in gdmphotosetup.c since
	  this is a new 2.7 usntable function.  I will change it back when 2.8
	  is released.
	* config/Makefile.am: Changed install location of gdm.conf and
	  factory-gdm.conf to %datadir%/gdm

2005-07-21  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.glade: New file.
	* gui/Makefile.am: Add glade file.
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Rewritten to be more HIG compliant, use
	  GtkIconView, include preview in file selector, and be instant apply.

2005-07-21  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c:  C89 compliance patch provided by Jens Granseuer.
	  <jensgr@gmx.net>.  Fixes bug #311097.

2005-07-21  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c:
	  Remove unused gtkmessagedialog.h header file.
	* gui/gdmchooser-strings.c, gui/gdmchooser.gladep,
	  gui/gdmsetup-strings.c, gui/gdmsetup.gladep: Removing these files
	  from the module since they are not needed.  The *.glade files are now
	  translated directly.  This fixes bug #310857.

2005-07-20  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/happygnome.xml: Tweak the colors
	  in the user list.  Make the background translucent behind the user
	  list.
	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c (greeter_populate_user_list): Make
	  real name bold if it is available.  Design for humans.
	  (force_no_tree_separators): Set treeview style so that we don't get
	  strange lines between tree rows when we set a userlist color in the
	  theme.  (greeter_item_ulist_setup): Only shrink the size of the user
	  list.  Set the default widget style.
	* gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c (greeter_item_create_canvas_item):
	  Don't set rules hint for userlist treeview.

2005-07-20  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* utils/gdm-dmx-reconnect-proxy.c: Fixed grammar, fixing bug #310958.

2005-07-20  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.in: TCP Wrappers now works on Solaris.

2005-07-20  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmcommon.c, gdmwm.c: Moved
	  gdm_common_show_info_msg, gdm_common_msg and gdm_common_query from
	  gdmcommon.c to gdmwm.c.  Now no longer include gdmwm.[ch] in
	  libgdmcommon.a since these are in libgdmwm.a:  This is cleaner since
	  these 3 functions reference gdmwm functions.  This fixes a link
	  problem on Solaris caused because the Xinerama functions were getting
	  referenced in gdmsetup even though they are unused.  
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Now use chmod instead of g_chmod.

2005-07-19  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Backed out calls to g_chmod since gdm2 should
	  not depend on glib functions only available in an unstable build
	  (2.7).

2005-07-19  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c (gdm_greeter_users_init): 
	Use common function for loading face images.
	
	* gui/greeter/greeter.c (greeter_ctrl_handler):
	Update for new common code.

	* gui/gdmuser.c (gdm_user_alloc): Use common function for
	loading face images.
	(setup_user): Define as static.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_kill_thingies): Make static.
	(gdm_login_ctrl_handler): Update for new gdm_common_login_sound.
	Add gdm_kill_thingies before all abort calls since they are
	not in gdm_common_abort anymore.
	(main): Use new common get face function.

	* gui/Makefile.am:
	* gui/gdmcommon.c (gdm_common_show_info_msg, gdm_common_login_sound):
	Make more common by not depending on external variables.
	(gdm_common_abort): Make more common by not depending on
	external functions.
	(gdm_common_get_face): Add a common function for loading
	face images.

	* daemon/slave.c (path_is_local, check_user_file) 
	(check_global_file, get_facefile_from_gnome2_dir_config) 
	(get_facefile_from_home, get_facefile_from_global, run_pictures):
	Don't stat or read from remote home directories.  Fixes #310545.

	* configure.in:
	* daemon/Makefile.am:
	* daemon/fstype.c: Add ability to detect filesystem types.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c (gdm_greeter_users_init): 
	* gui/gdmlogin.c (main):
	Try GTK+ themed icon stock_person before falling back to
	nobody.png.  Fixes #310906.

2005-07-19  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_login_gui_init):
	  Use HIG style button layout.  Fixes #310549.

2005-07-19  Tommi Vainikainen  <thv@iki.fi>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing, config/Xsession.in, daemon/display.c,
	daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, docs/C/gdm.xml,
	gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmcomm.c,
	gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.c,
	gui/gdmsetup.glade, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	gui/greeter/greeter_session.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:
	Cleanup terminology, and fix many strings. See bug #310453.
	Also fixes bug #308287. List of the most important string changes:
	machine -> computer
	program -> application or command
	superuser -> root
	gdm, Gdm -> GDM
	See the Language chapter in GNOME HIG for more information.

2005-07-14  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/getvt.c, daemon/gdm.c: Support 
	  DragonFly VT since it is the same as FreeBSD.
	  Patch provided by Joerg Sonnenberger
	  <joerg@bec.de>.  Fixes bug #310218.

2005-07-13  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c (main): Use new gstdio
	functions and set correct permission on .face.

2005-07-11  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.in: Cleaned up configure file.
	* gui/gdmsession.c: Changed "Gnome" to "GNOME".

2005-06-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.8.0.1
	* NEWS, configure.in:  Updated for new release.

2005-06-30  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Corrected grammar.  Thanks to Martin Petersen for
	  noticing this.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.c:  No longer use C99 features that do
	  not work with gcc 2.95, specifically do not declare variables except
	  at the beginning of a block.  Fixes bug #309110, patch provied by
	  Jens Granseuer <jensgr@gmx.net>.
	* autgogen.sh: Add back USE_GNOME_MACROS2=1 It doesn't do anything if
	  using GNOME 2.10 or later, but allows people using older
	  gnome-autogen.sh to build.

2005-06-22  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.in, vicious-extensions/Makefile.am,
	  daemon/Makefile.am, gui/Makefile.am, 
	  gui/greeter/Makefile.am: Upgrading to pkgconfig 0.17.2 broke the
	  Solaris build because it no longer allows the linker to pull in
	  libraries that are implicitely included.  Now explicitely specify the
	  dependant libraries and ensure they are included in the link
	  statements for each binary.
	* verify-pam.c: Minor correction to Solaris audit logic provided by
	  Gary Winiger.  <Gary.Winiger@sun.com>

2005-06-20  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* autogen.sh: Updated REQUIRED_AUTOMAKE_VERSION from 1.4 to 1.5 since
	  it no longer requires 1.4 and gnome-autogen.sh would complain if you
	  had a newer version of automake.  Fixes bug #307543.

	* daemon/slave.c: On 04/25, a change was made to move seteuid/setegid
	  to before checking the existance of the user's $HOME id to fix bug
	  #301821.  That patch added new seteuid/setegid calls before the
	  check, but didn't remove the calls after the check.  Calling these
	  functions twice is needless and was causing problems on NetBSD
	  (refer to bug #301821), so now fixing the logic so it doesn't
	  needlessly call the function twice.  This fixes bug #301821.  Patch
	  provided by Julio M. Merino Vidal.  This fixes bug #301821.

2005-06-17  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c:  Fix Delete button sensitivity.  Fixes part of bug
	  #302354.  Patch by Andrew Case.

2005-06-17  Julio M. Merino Vidal <jmmv84@gmail.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Fix duplicate entity ID so that the document
	  validates correctly.  Fixes bug #308048.

2005-06-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmcomm.c, 
	  gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c, 
	  gui/gdmwm.c:  Fix leaks.  Addresses bug #307482.  Patch provided by
	  Kjartan Maraas.
	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c, 
	  gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:  Remove needless "\n" from syslog
	  calls.

2005-06-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c, gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:
	  Now log messages to syslog since you can't see messages printed to
	  stdout/stderr when running under gdm2.  Now only print messages if
	  GDM_DEBUG_GESTURES environment variable is set to TRUE.  Cleaned up
	  the code so it is more readible.  No longer modify PATH since gdm2
	  now puts full path to executables in the gesture listener config
	  files.  More secure.

2005-06-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* vicious-extensions/ve-gnome.c:  Remove reference to libgnome.  The
	  daemon should not depend on libgnome.  Patch provided by Andrew Case.
	  Fix for bug #117889.

2005-06-11  Juerg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	* configure.in: Use ksh on solaris only.  Fixes bug #307250.

2005-06-10  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.8.0.0
	* configure.in: Updated version
	* NEWS: Updated
	* gui/Makefile.am: Fixed so faces subdir gets distributed.
	* gui/faces/Makefile.am: Fixed so faces subdir builds with distcheck.

2005-06-10  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup-strings.c, gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade:  Removed
	  "No Image" button for setting the background since it is redundant.
	   You can also say "no background" on the radio button list.

2005-06-10  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Updated setting for gdmsetup, gdmlogin, and
	  gdmchooser so they point to the new installation locations.  Fixes
	  bug #306464.
	* configure.in: Fix enable-ipv6 so it works.  Fixes bug #306558.  Patch
	  provided by foser@gentoo.org.
	* gui/gdmsetup-strings.c, gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade,
	  config/gdm.h, daemon/gdm.h:  Add Xserver configuration tab to
	  gdmsetup.  Minor cleanup of gdmsetup.c and better documentation.
	  Fixes bug #89421.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade: Now "Turn on Face Browser" is on
	  Security tab, which makes more sense.  Face Browser tab is now
	  insensitive if not turned on.  Rearranged tabs so they seem a bit
	  more clean.

2005-06-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:
	  Change "reboot" to "restart".  Changed function names and variables
	  from reboot to restart.  It's still "reboot_button" in the GDM2 theme
	  XML files since changing this would break backwards compatibility.
	  Fixes bug #305939.  Patch for gdmlogin by Nicholas Skehin.  I updated
	  the patch so it also applies to gdmgreeter.
	  
2005-06-02  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmdynamic.c:  Added new file so build works.

2005-05-25  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, config/gdm.conf.in,
	  config/Xsession.in, README.install: Now allow xevie to be turned on
	  for server-Standard.  This is for better a11y support.  Now use
	  /bin/ksh for Xsession shell if on Solaris instead of /bin/sh.  This
	  is needed to support Solaris users who are using ksh or bash as their
	  $HOME shell.

2005-05-17  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/misc.c, daemon/verify-pam.c,
	  docs/C/gdm.xml, gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmdynamic.c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in: Added support for dynamic Xservers.  Fixes
	  enhancement request #168219.  Patch provided by Bob Terek
	  <Robert.Terek@sun.com>.

2005-05-16  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in:  Fixed comments.

2005-05-16  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Now use gi18n.h instead of libgnome header files to get access to
	  translation code.  libgnome is still used in vicious-extensions, so
	  this still needs to be cleaned up before bug #117889 is fully fixed.
	  Patch provided by Christian - Manny Calavera - Neumair.
	* configure.in:  Backed out adding zh_HK to ALL_LINGUAS since it breaks
	  the build.
	
2005-05-16  Danilo \305\240egan  <dsegan@gmx.net>

	* gui/gdmsetup-strings.c: Removed.
	* gui/gdmchooser-strings.c: Removed.

	* gui/Makefile.am: Remove gdmchooser-strings.c and gdmsetup-strings.c,
	  as well as duplicate entries for glade files from EXTRA_DIST.  Fixes
	  bug #55635

2005-05-16  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c:  Fix broken messages.  Fixes bug #304377.
	  Thanks to Leena Gunda.
	* configure.in: Added zh_HK to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-05-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm-net.c: Fix gdm2 so it works better on BSD and MacOS.  Upon
	  getting EOF on a socket/pipe/etc.  G_IO_IN is always set and G_IO_HUP
	  may not be set.  Therefore, the 0 return from read() is important.
	  If we get a length <= 0 from read() we force the socket to be closed.
	  This prevents gdm-binary from causing high CPU-load after logout.
	  Fixes bug #172491.  Fix posted by Joe Marcus Clarke.

2005-05-13  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: No longer set default font size.  Thanks to
	  Erwann Chenede for catching this.

2005-05-10  Leena Gunda  <leena.gunda@wipro.com>

	* daemon/server.c (do_server_wait): Check if a host has been selected
	  from XDMCP chooser and change servstat accordingly. Fixes bug where
	  Xnest session quits when a host is selected from XDMCP chooser.

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.[ch],
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-pam.c,
	  daemon/xdmcp.c, AUTHORS:  Rename console and TYPE_LOCAL in
	  preparation for adding the dynamic Xserver patch.  This is part of
	  the fix for bug #168219.  Patch provided by Bob Terek.

2005-05-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmcommon.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c:
	  Refactored the code so session menu setup code is no longer
	  duplicated in gdmlogin adn gdmgreeter.
	  
2005-05-03  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Correct Makefile so that if CONSOLE_HELPER is set, we
	  don't try to create an /sbin/gdmsetup symlink to gdmsetup.  Now
	  gdmsetup is already installed to /sbin always.  Fixes #302319.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Fix sensitivity of the "Delete Theme" button.  Fixes
	  bug #302342.
	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: Now only set
	  user/password entry to PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE if HAVE_PAM is defined,
	  otherwise set it to GDM_MAX_PASS set to 256 in daemon/gdm.h.  This 
	  allows gdm to be used on systems that do not have PAM.  Fixes
	  #302228.  Patch by Ali Akcaagac.
	* daemon/gdm.h, docs/C/gdm.xml, gui/gdmsetup.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade, 
	  gui/gdmsetup-strings.c, config/gdm.conf.in: Now support random
	  theme.  Fixes #302354.  Patch by Andrew Case.
	* gui/gdmcommon.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c, gui/Makefile.am,
	  added gui/gdmsession.[ch]:  Support better sorting for session names.
	  Fixes #301818.  Patch by Ray Strode.

2005-04-26  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in:  Now use more sensible arguments
	  for starting magnifier, recommended by Bill Haneman.  

2005-04-25  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon-verify-pam.c,
	  gui/gdmcomm.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.c,
	  vicious-extensions/glade-helper.c:  Fix typos in strings.  Fixes bug
	  #301694.  Patch provided by Kjartan Maraas.
	* daemon/slave.c: To support when one username can be mapped to another
	  canonical username, we use the loginname that pwent returns instead
	  of the one that was typed in.  Fixes bug #301820.  Patch provided by
	  Mike Patnode.  Now use seteuid before checking existance of user's
	  home directory since root doesn't always have access and fails
	  otherwise.  Fixes bug #301821.  Patch provided by Ray Strode.
	* gui/greeter/Makefile.am,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c:
	  Added:  gui/greeter/canvas_text.[ch]: No longer rely on Xserver
	  physical screen geometry which sometimes causes text to be too big or
	  too small.  Now use gdk/pango functions to get root window resources.
	  Fixes bug #301824.  Patch provided by Ray Strode.
	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h, docs/C/gdm.xml, gui/gdmlogin.c:
	  Now support background programs that are started after a timedelay
	  and can be restarted after a delay.  Useful for running a screensaver
	  at login time.  Fixes bug #301528.  Patch provided by Laurent Birtz.

2005-04-22  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/modules/keymouselistner.c: Corrected broken if test pointed out
	  by meissner@suse.de.  Fixes bug #301565.

2005-04-22  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Add the ability to make GDM spawn XDMCP sessions on a local
	X proxy server. Experimental support for disconnect/reconnect
	or "session migration" is also implemented using DMX.
	More details in bug #301602.

	* configure.in: require glib 2.6.0 and check for DMX.
	
	* config/gdm.conf.in: add xdmpc/EnableProxy, xdmcp/ProxyXServer
	and xdmcp/ProxyReconnect config keys.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: document new config keys.

	* daemon/gdm.h: add TYPE_XDMCP_PROXY server type, add #defines
	for the new config keys, re-name various xnest related GdmDisplay
	members to be applicable for all proxy servers, add xdmcp_dispnum
	GdmDisplay member, modify the format of GDM_SOP_QUERYLOGIN and
	add GDM_SOP_AUTHFILE and GDM_SOP_MIGRATE.

	* daemon/gdm.c: read the new config keys, change format of what
	GDM_SOP_QUERYLOGIN returns, implement GDM_SOP_AUTHFILE and 
	GDM_SOP_MIGRATE.

	* daemon/xdmcp.h: add gdm_xdmcp_migrate.

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: when xdmpc/EnableProxy and xdmcp/ProxyXServer,
	set things up such that a proxy sever (which displays on the
	requesting X server) is run locally by the slave.
	Also implement migrating the proxy server from one parent display
	to another using the xdmcp/ProxyReconnect command.

	* daemon/server.c: if we're running a proxy server (e.g. Xnest
	or Xdmx), hold a connection open to the parent display so that
	it doesn't reset.
	Run proxy servers with -display rather than setting $DISPLAY.

	* daemon/slave.c:
	Once we've successfully logged the user in, send SOP_QUERYLOGIN
	to the slave - if the result from that indicates that the user
	is already logged in and that session is migratable (e.g. by
	reconnecting a proxy server or changing the VT), then migrate
	to the existing session using SOP_MIGRATE.
	In the case of an Xdmcp proxy, hold open the connection to the
	parent display so that it doesn't reset. Exit the slave as
	soon as that connection closes.

	* utils/Makefile.am, utils/gdm-dmx-reconnect-proxy.c: implementation
	of xdmcp/ProxyReconnect for use with Xdmx.
	
2005-04-21  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	Don't use gdm_debug() from signal handlers - the message formatting and
	the syslog() both involve malloc() which isn't safe in signal
	handlers. Fixes random lockups with debugging enabled.

	* daemon/server.c:
	(gdm_server_usr1_handler),
	(gdm_server_child_handler): don't use gdm_debug() here.
	
	* daemon/slave.c:
	(gdm_slave_usr2_handler),
	(gdm_slave_child_handler): or here.

2005-04-20  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: For Danish-English use en_DK instead of en_IE.
	* gui/gdmsetup: Fix sensitivities of new Login Sounds feature.  Further
	  fix for #300136. Provided by Andrew Case.
	* HACKING: Made less out-of-date.

2005-04-19  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmchooser.c, giu/gdmlogin.c:  Cleanup for login success/failure
	  sounds.  Patch provided by Mark McLoughlin.  Refer to bug #300136.
	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix FlexiServer commands so that all output for a
	  single command is sent as a single call to gdm_connection_write or
	  gdm_connection_printf rather than building commands and sending them
	  out in pieces.  Also use gdm_connection_printf rather than building
	  so many temporary strings.  Patch provided by for
	  GDM_SUP_QUERY_LOGOUT_ACTION, but I reworked the patch so the same
	  technique is used for all gdmflexiserver commands.  Fixes bug
	  #158799.  Patch based on one provided by Raffaele Sandrini
	  <rasa@gmx.ch>
	* gui/greeter/greeter_geometry.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.h,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c, docs/C/gdm.xml:  Now support ratio
	  scaling of SVG images.  Docs weren't provided with the patch so I
	  added some.  Patch provided by.  Fixes bug 159524.  Patch provided by
	  Vincent Untz <vincent@vuntz.net>.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Rearrange how the widgets are organized to make it
	  look a bit better now that the message fields have sizes defined to
	  avoid gdm2 resizing.  Bit more of a fix for bug #117779.
	* README.install: Spell corrections and minor updates, now mention that
	  running configure with the option --with-post-path=/usr/openwin/bin
	  is recommended on Solaris.
	* MAINTAINERS, AUTHORS, NEWS, docs/C/gdm.xml, daemon/gdm.h: Fixed
	  spelling, added contributors to AUTHORS file for patches made in the
	  past few months.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Fixed bug 300138 by providing better sound docs in
	  the a11y section.  Fixes bug #300138.  Patch provided by Andrew Case.
	* gui/gdmsetup.glade, gui/gdmsetup-strings.c: Removed strings "sdfg"
	  and "asdf" since they can't be translated.  Fixes bug #301211.
	* gui/gdmchooser.c: Removed needless comment.
 	* config/Init: Removed generated file from CVS.

2005-04-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, docs/C/gdm.xml,
	  gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmcommon.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, 
	  gui/gdmsetup-strings.c, gui/gdmsetup.c,
	  gui/gdmsetup.glade, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h:  Add login success/failure
	  sounds.  Patch provided by Andrew Case.  Refer to bug #300136.

2005-04-18  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: I noticed that
	  double clicking in the Face Browser was causing the focus to be taken
	  away from the username/password entry field.  I added a
	  button-release-event listener that returns the focus back to the
	  entry field when the user clicks on the Face Browser.  This ensures
	  that the focus is always kept on the entry field where it should be.

2005-04-15  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade, gui/gdmsetup-strings.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c: Added DefaultWelcome and
	  DefaultRemoteWelcome keys to the config file which
	  cause the default strings to be used.  This allows
	  us to better translate the string in gdmsetup for
	  display and fixes bug #300304.
	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c, gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/happygnome.xml: Now allow theming
	  of background colors in the Face Browser.  Also shrink the
	  FaceBrowser so it is the same size as the treeview, so a big white
	  space is not displayed under the FaceBrowser.  I probably did not
	  pick good default colors in the xml file, but perhaps someone with a
	  better design eye can give me a recommendation for better colors.
	  Fixes bug #140312.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Added docs for above two features.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Moved auto_timed_msg label after msg label since that
	  looks better.
	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Moved call to g_signal_lookup so it happens when the
	  call works.

2005-04-12  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* Release 2.6.0.9
	* configure.in: Updated version
	* NEWS: Updated

2005-04-12  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Display an error dialog if the user's $HOME/.dmrc
	  can't be accessed for permissions reasons.  Fixes bug 141126.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c: Now tab acts like
	  enter.  Fixes bug #127339.  * gui/gdmsetup.c: Fixed theme installer
	  so it remembers where the last theme was installed from and opens the
	  file browser in that location.  Fixes bug #164785.  Also fixed a
	  bug which was causing only *tar.gz files to be installable.  Now it
	  works for *.tar files on my system.

2005-04-11  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/locale.alias:  Patched locale.alias to include missing
	  languages.  Patch provided by Ray Dassen.
	* gui/gdmchooser.c: Make button 3 always act like button1 for the
	  chooser as well, further fixes bug #155142.
	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: Support Control-U for blanking
	  the username/password entry.  Fixes bug #103498.  Also removed 
	  needless ";" from include lines.
	* gdm/gdmsetup.c: Now clicking "No Logo" or "No background" image
	  causes gdmlogin to update itself immediately.  Also fixed "Timed
	  Login" enable checkbox so it takes effect immediately when changed.

2005-04-08  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: Now make
	  button3 always act like button 1 for better left-hand support.  No
	  longer just set this for the login/setup programs when
	  RUNNING_UNDER_GDM is set since gdmsetup can be run from console and 
	  so can gdmlogin (for development).  gdmgreet needs this so the
	  Actions and Languages pop-up dialogs work with the left mouse.  Aside
	  from such pop-ups the logic in greeter_events was taking care of
	  this.  Fixes bug #155142.
	  Also increased the max size of the username password field to
	  PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE to fix bug #144809.  I talked with the PAM expert
	  here at Sun and he recommended using this value.  Lastly, fixed a bug
	  I introduced on the 6th so now I really fixed bug #67647.
	* daemon/gdm.c: Now the GDM daemon recognizes if the user changed the
	  "Enable debug" value in gdmsetup.  I added the checkbox to gdmsetup
	  on the 4th.

2005-04-07  Gareth Owen  <gowen72@yahoo.com>

	* po/en_GB.po: Updated British English translation.

2005-04-06  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Set size requests for text labels in gdmlogin so that
	  they are initialized with a big enough size to avoid container
	  resizing.  Fixes bug #117779.  Also no longer place the "msg" label
	  in the button box, instead placing it above.  This label can get too
	  big to really fit in the button box without resizing or otherwise
	  making the GUI look weird.

	  vicious-extensions/test-ve-config.c,
	  vicious-extensions/ve-i18n.h, vicious-extensions/vicious.h,
	  vicious-extensions/viciousui.h:  Changed messages so that
	  I-form isn't used.  Fixes bug #118193.  Noticed many
	  files didn't have a GPL license as a comment at the top
	  of the file, so added those.  Changed "Gnome" to "GNOME"
	  in comments.  
	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Now display timed login message in a
	  separate label, which avoids problems caused because different
	  things (PAM, timed login, etc.) are trying to use the same
	  label for status messages.  This fixes bug #67647. 

2005-04-05  Adam Weinberger  <adamw@gnome.org>

	* gui/gdmsetup-strings.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade: Removed
	  space before punctuation.

2005-04-04  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmcommon.c, gui/gdmcommon.h, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:  Fixed dialogs that ask user if they
	  want to change their default language/session so they have a Cancel
	  button that returns the user to the login screen without having to
 	  login/logout to change their session/language session.  Also added
	  mnemonics to the Languages menu in gdmlogin.c.  Fixed minor bug
	  where gdmlogin and gdmgreeter were checking Include and Exclude list
	  as booleans rather than strings.  Fixes bugs #117776 and #168118.
	* gui/gdmsetup-strings.c, gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade: Now allow
	  user to turn on/off debug on the Security tab.  Minor cleanup.

2005-04-01  Pawan Chitrakar  <pawan@nplinux.org>

	* configure.in: Added ne in ALL_LINGUAS

2005-03-31  Steve Murphy  <murf@e-tools.com>

	* configure.in: Added "rw" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-04-01  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.in: Change Solaris HaltCommand from "init 0" to "init 5" as
	  Sun's ARC has informed me.

2005-04-01  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmsetup-strings.c,
	  gui/gdmsetup.glade: Revamped gdmsetup so that it uses the new file
	  browser everywhere, uses GtkComboBox and GtkComboBoxEntry instead of
	  GtkEntry and GtkOptionMenu since they are deprecated.  This fixed bug
	  #171558.  Improved Remote Welcome label to fix bug 105156.  Now
	  Remote Greeter option in the Greeter tab reads "Disabled" if XDMCP
	  is disabled.  It returns to the real choice if XDMCP is enabled
	  again.  This fixes bug 117888.  Also changed glade widget names for
	  the face browser to have the "fb" prefix rather than "sg".  Some
	  other minor cleanup of the glade file.  Also added ability to turn
	  on/off Theme menu choice from the Accessibility tab in gdmsetup.
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: On March 10th I fixed gdmphotosetup so it uses
	  the new file browser.  I noticed that the code had a bug which was
	  causing an assert, now fixed.  Now make the file browser work more
	  like the ones gdmsetup.c
	* gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in: Make GNOME in all-caps to fix bug #167054.
	  
2005-03-29  Brian Cameron  <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Correct inconsistant spacing in languages list.

2005-03-25  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linuxhall.org>

	  gui/gdmuser.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/gdmsetup-strings.c, docs/C/gdm.xml:  Add face browser tab for
	  configuring the face browser with the Exclude options and the new
	  Include and IncludeAll configuration options.  Cleaned up the
	  gdmsetup glade file a bit.  Now tabs have mnemonics
	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c, gui/greeter/gdmthemetester.c:
	  Changed name of "Graphical Greeter" to "Themed Greeter" and
	  "Standard Greeter" to "GTK+ Greeter".

2005-03-21  Brian Cameron   <Brian.Cameron@sun.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Remove "en" from language list since it causes

	  vicious-extensions/glade-helper.c:

Thu Mar 17 2:30:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* config/extract-shell.sh: Made comment nicer.
	* gui/gdmlanguages.c:   Fix for bug 132629, it disambiguates the
	  otherwise identical entries described in the bug report by showing
	  their encoding.  Adding Hong Kong to table.  Patch by Seb Wills.
	   Also added Hong Kong to table.
	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:  Fix message as per bug #167649.
	* README.intall: Added more security information and information about
	  installing on Solaris.

Thu Mar 17 2:06:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* configure.in, gui/greeter/gdmthemetester.in (added),
	  gui/greeter/gdmthemetester (removed):  Fixed so it recognizes
	  gdmgreeter is installed to LIBEXEC and now uses gdmwhich instead of
	  which (same logic that the Init, PreSession, etc. scripts) so it
	  works better on Solaris.
	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,

	  gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/happygnome.xml:  Made face browser
	  much less braindead.  The facebrowser is no longer insensitive when
	  entering the password so you can change the selected user without
	  having to enter an invalid password.  Also added a cancel button
	  which allows user to reselect a different username without having to
	  enter an invalid password.  Removed the stupid double-click
	  requirement to select a user with the face browser.  Now just
	  clicking on a user takes you to password entry.  Clicking the cancel
	  button unselects all users in the face browser and takes the user
	  back to the Username prompt.

	  docs/C/gdm.xml:  Added Include and IncludeAll gdm config options to
	  better control what users are displayed in the face browser.
	  Consolidated the almost identical logic from gdmlogin.c, gdmsetup.c
	  and greeter_item_ulist.c into gdm_user.[ch].
	* daemon/gdm.h: Correct setting of HALT_COMMAND, which got fat-fingered
	  when I moved the setup of this to the configure file.
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Mark strings for translation.

Thu Mar 10 17:50:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in: Changed default face directory to
	  EXPANDED_DATADIR/pixmaps/faces since putting the faces subdirectory
	  in pixmaps simply makes more sense.
	* Makefile.am, acconfig.h, configure.in, gdmsetup-security.in,
	  daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/gdm.in, daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/greeter/Makefile.am,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c: Changed the way GDM files are installed.  Now
	  all programs intended to be run by root are in EXPANDED_SBINDIR
	  (gdm/gdm-binary/gdmsetup), all programs that are not intended to be
	  run by end-users are in EXPANDED_LIBEXEC
	  (gdmchooser/gdmgreeter/gdmlogin).  Removed gdmconfig wrapper script
	  and gdmXnest symlink since they only serve to clutter the filesystem.
	  I announced this change in the 2.6.0.8 release notes and will be
	  bumping the next release to 2.6 because of this change and the change
	  to the default face directory.
	* configure.in, gui/faces/*: Add default faces.  Images provided by
	  Jaap A. Haitsma.  Refer to bugzilla bug #149838.
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Now browser will look in the system face
	  directory first, in EXPANDED_DATADIR/pixmaps if the default face
	  directory does not exist.
	* config/Makefile.am: Changed name of Default to Init since that
	  follows the naming standard used by the other scripts.  Fixes bug
	  #118278.
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated docs with information about the changes in
	  today's commits.
	  
Thu Mar 10 14:35:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/gdm.c:  Added GET_CONFIG gdmflexiserver command,
	  so that other programs can access the GDM configuration data in a
	  stable way.  This is useful for progrmas that might want to know what
	  the system suspend command is, or what the max icon size is for
	  creating face images.
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Fix bugs 126796, 143618, and 159025 since it no
	  longer crashes, uses the new file chooser, and now automatically
	  scales images down to the max icon height/width.

Thu Mar 10 14:16:00 2005  Adi Attar  <aattar@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added "xh" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Tue Mar 08 14:35:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in: Added -u when launching
	  magnifier so it is launched in horizontal split mode which works
	  better.
	* acconfig.h, configure.in, AccessDwellMouseEvents.in,
	  AccessKeyMouseEvents.in: Now use full path to AT programs so gesture
	  listeners do not depend on the PATH environment variable to run.  By
	  default gdm with use EXPANDED_BINDIR, but this can be overridden via
	  the --with-at-bindir configure option.

Mon Mar 07 14:35:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* Release 2.6.0.8
	* configure.in: Updated version.
	* NEWS, ChangeLog, README, README.install, HACKING, TODO,
	  daemon/auth.c daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/gdm.c daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, gui/gdmcomm.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: Corrected
	  spelling and use better english.

Mon Mar 07 12:20:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* gdmlanguages.c: Removed zh_HK since it is not appropriate to make
	  this change in the string freeze. 
	 
Fri Mar 04 12:50:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: Set default font size to Sans 12.  Can make
	  the default configurable if people want.  (Patch by Erwann Chenede)

	  for more friendly a11y.  (Patch by Erwann Chenede)
	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Mark "Remove Theme" for translation.  (Patch by
	  Balamurali Viswanathan).
	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Add zh_HK and remove <span> tags in language
	  display since they were causing formatting problems for some users.
	  (Patch by Glynn Foster)
	* daemon/gdm.in: Ensure LC_MESSAGES is set so the user's default
	  language can be displayed.  (Patch by Hidetoshi Tajima).
	* daemon/misc.c, daemon/xdmcp.c: Fix XDMCP for IPv6.  Now properly
	  handle IPv4 requests when received when the code is built with
	  --enable-ipv6=true and fix IPv6 identification on Solaris.  (Patch by
	  Leena Gunda and Brian Cameron).
	* configure.in: Fix --enable-ipv6 help line when you run "configure
	  --help".  (Patch by Brian Cameron)

Fri Feb 25 14:44:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* configure.in:  Corrected setting of Xnest command so it works on
	  Linux.  Broken by my Feb 02 patch.

Wed Feb 16 11:00:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/happygnome.xml: Specify font for
	  username/password entry field for the gdm2 supplied themes.  Fixes
	  bug #164822.  Patch provided by Alexander Kirillov.

Tue Feb 15 14:42:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c (gdm_greeter_users_init): Make the

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c:  Fix for bug 165880.  Adds Armenian to the
	  language selection menu.  Patch provided by petrosyan@gmail.com.

Mon Feb 14 17:35:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_geometry.c:  Fix for bug 136856.  Fixed width of
	  "user name entry" to shrink to fit its parent widget so the text
	  doesn't run out of bounds.  Patch provided by Chookij Vanatham.

Mon Feb 14 17:10:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/server.c,

	  (constrain_window): New, make sure a window doesn't overlap

	  better with gok.  Patch provided by Bill Haneman.

Mon Feb 14 16:20:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* acconfig.h, gui/modules/Makefile.am, 
	  gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c,
	  gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:  Updated files to also integrate
	  patch for bug #142834.  A second patch to support XInput devices with
	  the gesture listeners.  Patch provided by Bill Haneman
	  <Bill.Haneman@Sun.com>.
	
Mon Feb 14 15:10:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* configure.in, gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in,
	  gui/modules/Makefile.am, gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c,

	  and gnopernicus.  Fixes bug #142833.  Patch provided by Bill Haneman
	  <Bill.Haneman@Sun.com>.

Mon Feb 07 21:10:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

Thu Feb 02 14:20:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* configure.in, config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: Cleaned up
	  the way the user's default PATH is set and allow it to be
	  configurable.  Also allow default Halt, Reboot, and Suspend
	  commands to be different on Solaris.
	* acconfig.h: Cleanup, added new configure options.
	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c, vicious-extensions/glade-helper.c:

	  Christian Rose.
	
Wed Feb 02 11:20:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* Release 2.6.0.7

Tue Jan 28 15:35:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* This patch makes gdm2 build with newer versions of the build
	  tools.  Previously it was requiring automake-1.4, autoconf-1.4,
	  and aclocal-1.4.  Better error checking in the newer version
	  caught the following issues:
	* Makefile.am:  Added distuninstallcheck_listfiles for the
	  files in /var/scrollkeeper, which were causing "makedist"
	  to fail.  Removed intltool-modules/XML/Parser/Style/OrigTree.pm
	  from EXTRA_DIST since that file isn't required by newer 
	  versions of intltool.
	* omf.make, xmldocs.make:  Fixed errors in "makedist".   I found a
	  pointer to the fix here:
	  mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2003-December/msg00587.html
	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/themes/circles/Makefile.am,
	  gui/modules/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/Makefile.am,
	  config/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/Makefile.am:
	  Added clean-local and uninstall-hook to fix errors in "makedist".
	  Made sure all *.desktop files are in EXTRA_DIST.
	* daemon/slave.c: Not related to above patches.  Fixed grammar again
	  since we aren't in a string freeze.  Sorry for the confusion.  
	* autogen.sh: Now allow latest vicious-extensions to be included
	  in the release.  It was left out of the previous release due to
	  schedule freeze.

Tue Jan 25 17:18:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Fixed grammar.  Then backed out fix since just
	  realized we are in a string freeze.

Tue Jan 25 17:13:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* configure.in: Correct Solaris audit configure to include -lbsm when
	  needed.

Mon Jan 24 17:15:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Corrected g_strconcat call.  Patch provided by
	  meissner@suse.de

Thu Jan 19 18:25:00 2005  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.Com>

	* NEWS, MAINTAINERS: Added myself.  George has asked me to assist with
	  maintainership duties.

Thu Jan 13 17:59:05 2005  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmwm.c: don't init the wm twice if gdm_wm_init is called
	  twice.  Fixes the greeter hanging if something went wrong with
	  loading the theme.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: always destroy the dialog widget because
	  sometimes we don't actually exit.  Fixes non-fatal error dialogs
	  hanging around.

Tue Dec 14 12:23:35 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: fix very unlikely possible leak

	  and South African English

2004-11-27  Dwayne Bailey  <dwayne@translate.org.za>

Tue Oct 26 16:31:05 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.6.0.6

Tue Oct 26 15:51:58 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: update comments to reflect that the vt stuff
	  works on freebsd as well as linux

Tue Oct 26 15:24:21 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: Add a global cookie in <ServAuthDir>/.cookie which
	  can be used to authenticate if no display is available.

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: add a SOP command to launch a new flexiserver
	  by "echo FLEXI_XSERVER >/var/lib/gdm/.gdmfifo"  No error detection
	  is possible then of course.  Patch from Tuukka Hastrup
	  <Tuukka.Hastrup@iki.fi> with some fixup to make it actually work
	  right.

Tue Oct 26 14:50:34 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c: Make autologin work on a second
	  display if the first display started is an unhandled or a chooser
	  server.

2004-10-21  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, config/gdm.conf.in: Set up Xnest
	  so it works properly on Solaris.

2004-10-14  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Minor change to wording in comments.

2004-10-05  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* config/locale.alias: Prefer nb_NO locale.

Fri Oct 01 12:07:18 2004  Ray Strode  <rstrode@redhat.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c (selection_changed):
	Ensure that selection iterator is valid before using it.

Thu Sep 30 20:49:26 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: set GDM_XSERVER_LOCATION with the x server type

Thu Sep 30 10:50:00 2004  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: Now declare GdmUserId and GdmGroupId as
	  extern to avoid warnigns.

Wed Sep 29 17:15:00 2004  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/verify-pam.c: Cleaned up code and moved
	  final di_devperm_logout call in gdm.c so it properly resets
	  permissions to root when gdm-stop is run.

Tue Sep 22 12:45:00 2004  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/verify-pam.c: Modification to logindevperm
	  logic so that device permissions are given to the gdm user
	  while gdm is running.  This allows a11y programs like
	  gnopernicus to access the sound device for text-to-speech.
	  Minor correction to the logindevperm logout logic in 
	  verify-pam.c so that di_devperm_logout isn't called in
	  situations where di_devperm_login was not called.

Tue Sep 15 12:45:00 2004  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* configure.in: Corrected check for Solaris auditing API so it
	  will not set HAVE_ADT when building on Solaris 9 and earlier.
	  The auditing API supported in gdm2 is only supported on the
	  next release of Solaris.

Tue Sep 14 15:29:22 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.6.0.5

2004-08-27  Akagic Amila  <bono@linux.org.ba>

	* configure.in: Added 'bs' to ALL_LINGUAS.

Thu Aug 26 15:55:00 2004  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Updated docs to include gdmflexiserver command
	  options, arguments for all GDM programs aside from gdm-binary
	  (which was already there), added accessibility section, and
	  cleaned up the XML so it is more readible.  Also added a 
	  comment that gdmlogin now lets you change the theme from the
	  menu.

Tue Aug 24 12:27:00 2004  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* verify-pam.c: No longer call logindevperm if not logging into
	  the console.  This corrects problems discovered by testing
	  on Solaris.

Wed Aug 18 13:12:29 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.6.0.4

Wed Aug 18 13:00:09 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: create .dmrc non group/world readable, though that's
	  probably just being overly strict.

Wed Aug 18 12:28:52 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Fix #143707 by using Exclude= as well for
	  the dropdown lists.

Wed Aug 18 12:15:39 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Fix #150293 by adding localized name for
	  Bosnian.

Wed Aug 18 11:54:29 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: don't resize the window after selection for
	  the amount of time it could take to double click, that way a
	  double click does not get lost.  Should fix some of the bugs,
	  but it seems they are mostly with the graphical greeter which is
	  not affected by this.

2004-08-16  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added nb to ALL_LINGUAS.

Wed Aug 11 03:45:00 2004  Brian Cameron  <brian.cameron@sun.com>

	* acconfig.h: Added HAVE_LOGINDEVPERM and HAVE_ADT
	* configure.in: Added checking for Solaris logindevperm and
	  auditing API's.
	* Add logic so gdm2 supports Solaris logindevperm and
	  auditing.

Tue Aug 10 08:53:32 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: I should learn how to spell Denmark

Tue Aug 03 16:42:04 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c, config/locale.alias: add Armenian to
	  fix #139454

Tue Aug 03 16:29:08 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: "fix" #148349 by adding French (Belgium),
	  French (Switzerland), German (Austria), German (Switzerland)
	  to the translation matrix applying the patch.  Patch from
	  Christian Rose

	* config/locale.alias: add de_AT, de_CH, fr_BE, fr_CH

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: normalize english names, patch mostly from
	  Christian Rose, #148350

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: fix #148356 by including a native version of
	  Azerbaijani language name

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: fix #148486 by including native name for
	  Gujarati

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: fix #148373 by fixing the greek language string

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: add en_DK just to have the translation, but
	  don't add it to config/locale.alias

	* configure.in: fixing #148042 by settings GETTEXT_PACKAGE to gdm

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: fix #147800 by changing the shortcut
	  for configure from c to g

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c, gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c:
	  Fix #147940 by actually checking if the command exists and not just
	  for NULLs, then disabling Halt, Suspend or Reboot is really as
	  simple as "RebootCommand=" as it is for gdmlogin

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmwm.c, gui/gdmcommon.c,
	  gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c:
	  fix some compiler warnings

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix #144076, 144077, the request denied errors
	  that are printed to syslog now just give the request by real name
	  instead of making it look like part of the sentence and so it
	  all makes more sense.

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: fix some compiler warnings

Fri Jul 02 Arvind Samptur  <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	* configure.in: Define a macro to set the xserver options
	  based on different xservers. Run Xsun with -nobanner

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Use the macro

Mon Aug 02 15:17:43 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	  sourcing any files which may screw up our argument array

	* Patch from Andreas Schubert <andreas.schubert@mathema.de>

	* daemon/filecheck.c, daemon/gdm.[ch]:  Add a CheckDirOwner key
	  to fix systems which have non-user-owned home dirs.

	* config/gdm.conf.in, doc/C/gdm.xml: Document the above addition.

Tue Jul 13 10:27:35 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:  Use "Shut _Down" instead of
	  "Shut_down" consistently.  This string was already being used
	  so it doesn't add any new strings

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/getvt.c: Add FreeBSD support for VTAllocation
	  from Alexander Nedotsukov <bland@FreeBSD.org>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Add mention that VTAllocation now works on FreeBSD
	  as well.

Fri Jun 11 10:46:46 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.6.0.3

Mon Jun 07 09:17:23 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing: Add system-config-display and also check
	  for system-config-mouse.  FC2 is utter crack when it comes to
	  failing X server anyway so on my test machine system-config-display
	  don't work none anyway, but such is life, maybe it'll work for
	  someone (but FC2 of course doesn't run that on X errors anyway).

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: replace hacks with lesser hacks

Tue Jun 01 11:24:46 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_canvas.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmcommon.[ch]:
	  on non-local displays, and on displays other then the primary
	  :0 display, disable cursor blinking after 20 seconds of
	  inactivity as it eats bandwidth and cpu for nothing.
	  Should fix #135764

	* gui/gdmwm.c: minor cosmetic cleanup

Fri May 28 12:53:42 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing, config/PreSession.in,
	  config/PostSession.in, config/Xsession.in, config/Default.in:
	  Don't use which but our own private shell version since solaris
	  which is broken when there is no TTY.  Fixes #133245, partly
	  based on a patch by Brian Cameron

Fri May 28 12:35:22 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c, config/Makefile.am: solaris chown doesn't like 
	  a dot separator but : is the standard separator and works for
	  gnu chown as well, so switch to that.  Thanks to
	  vix@vazka.sk (Ivan Noris).  Fixes #142732

Fri May 28 12:01:02 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: Cut after
	  the comma in the gecos field if there is more then one comma
	  as then it's probably ugly arguments and not the name.  Fixes
	  #142274

Fri May 28 11:43:41 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: Apply patch from
	  leonard.michlmayr@ap.univie.ac.at (Leonard Michlmayr),
	  to make the language dialog at most 600 pixels tall to make it
	  look prettier.  Fixes #142175

Fri May 28 11:36:46 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix for #141497, that is the last_x_failed is
	  properly reset, we only restart 3 times and we allow those
	  to happen in a much longer timeframe (5 minutes), which is OK
	  since we reset on successful remanage rather then just based
	  on time.

Fri May 28 11:08:51 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: eek, evil we had GETTEXT_PACKAGE set to
	  gdm-2.4, but we want gdm-2.6 nowdays

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.c: fix the ConsoleCannotHandle key
	  and cache it as soon as we can and also set
	  UNSAFE_TO_TRANSLATE=yes when forking something and console
	  can't handle the language

	* daemon/server.c: fix a minor fd leak and print a C locale
	  (don't want to translate this) error to the X log when the
	  X server cannot be exec'ed.

	* utils/gdmopen.c, utils/gdmtranslate.c, config/XKeepsCrashing:
	  Listen to UNSAFE_TO_TRANSLATE, since running shells in login
	  mode may modify the locale so we must force it to "C" where
	  we can if it is really unsafe (language in ConsoleCannotHandle)

Thu May 27 13:42:39 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c, gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:
	  The screen code was broken, it wanted HAVE_GTK_MULTIHEAD to be
	  defined to work properly and otherwise it confused bonobo which
	  is completely moronic (I mean bonobo is moronic) by using slightly
	  different (but perfectly legal) DISPLAY env var.

Wed May 26 18:23:14 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/misc.[ch],
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-pam.c, docs/C/gdm.xml,
	  config/gdm.conf.in:  Add a daemon/ConsoleCannotHandle key which
	  lists languages which should not be used on the console because
	  they won't work.  Uses "C" locale strings instead then.  Should
	  "fix" #135387, but I suppose there's no clean way to do this,
	  just let the distributors ship proper config files and have them
	  test it (yeah right).  I've tested the current set on RH9 and I
	  listed all of the ones that didn't work.

Wed May 26 17:34:51 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Ensure proper .ICEauthority permissions, this
	  may fail on NFS, but who cares, there if it breaks it's beyond
	  our fixage anyway.  Should alleviate problems from #137345, though
	  that bug is really in libice usage and gnome-session.  libice is
	  incredibly evil.

	* utils/gdmtranslate.c: fix with the forte compiler, patch from
	  Brian Cameron, fixes #137600

Wed May 26 17:01:16 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c, daemon/misc.c: use shell quoting more properly

Wed May 12 20:36:33 2004  James M. Cape <jcape@ignore-your.tv>

	* */.cvsignore: Updates.
	* configure.in, pixmaps/Makefile.am, pixmaps/*/*: Added new icons for
	  gdmflexiserver -xnest and gdmsetup. The old pixmaps stay in pixmaps
	  because they are not "themed-icons" per-se.
	* pixmaps/gdm.png: Removed the old icon.
	* gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in, gui/gdmflexiserver*.desktop.in: Use the new
	  icons.

Thu May 06 16:06:55 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.6.0.2

Thu May 06 15:56:36 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version, disable IPv6 by default, it's still
	  problematic and most use cases are IPv4 nowdays anyway.

Thu May 06 15:33:01 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/slave.[ch]: Fix #119853 thanks to
	  investigation by Frederic Crozat.  PAM sometimes doesn't
	  go away after we tell it to and keeps asking questions even though
	  we want it to shut up and die.  So just keep telling it until
	  we succeed.  Also change the name of the _should_complain function
	  to _action_pending since that's more appropriate

Thu May 06 15:18:07 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: attempt to fix #126984 and possibly others
	  where pam asks for the username AGAIN even though we gave it
	  a username.  PAM is on crack.  Just attempt to detect it and
	  give it the username without asking the user for it.

Thu May 06 09:59:48 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/misc.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.c,
	  gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: Apply and heavily
	  massage a patch from Muktha to add font setting to the theming
	  and finally fix #125070 hopefully 

	* daemon/misc.c: our gethostent should strip the ::ffff: since it's
	  confusing to rest of gdm and X in particular apparently, so whack
	  it from the hostname so that it doesn't get into the display
	  name.  Should fix #133246

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c: fix #123958
	  by having an empty message clear the message string rather then
	  append an empty string.  Evil, but it fixes the bug.  PAM is one
	  large bug in fact, and would require a rather large flywatter to
	  fix, based on a patch from Frederic Crozat

Tue May 04 09:47:21 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c: Don't whack the socket_conn on display_manage
	  since that completely whacks out flexiserver error reporting and
	  breaks flexiserver.  Whoops!  (I should review innocent looking
	  patches better)

2004-04-09  John C Barstow  <jbowtie@amathaine.com>

	* configure.in: Added "mi" (Maori) to ALL_LINGUAS.

Fri Apr 16 16:02:53 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update version information, no changes.  I should
	  have done this before the release.

Fri Apr 16 16:00:50 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.6.0.1

Fri Apr 16 15:08:25 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c: ensure clean building even if FamilyInternetV6
	  is not define (define it ourselves to '6' which is what it is)

	* configure.in: raise version

	* NEWS: update

Tue Apr 13 11:22:00 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: stop calling 'gdm' 'genius', I'm confusing
	  my projects :)

2004-04-09  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

	* configure.in: Added "gu" (Gujarati) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-04-08 Vijaykumar Patwari <vijaykumar.patwari@wipro.com>

	* daemon/auth.c (get_local_auths): Replaced Address Family, 
	FamilyInternet by FamilyInternetV6 for IPv6 while adding addresses 
	for authorization. Fixes "Remote login with IPv6 enabled".

Sun Apr 04 11:12:55 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c:
	  The ensure_sanity is now always called only from the main daemon
	  on display_manage (to avoid stepping on ones toes) and also it
	  checks /tmp/.X11-unix to have correct permissions as well.

Tue Mar 30 15:47:33 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Fixes from: Jerry Wall <Jerry.Wall@Sun.COM>

	* daemon/display.c: in whack_old_slave, make sure to close
	  any stale pipes/sockets just in case

	* daemon/gdm.c: ignore SIGPIPE, it is possible that the slave
	  dies in a bad moment and we get a SIGPIPE

2004-03-31  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "af" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-03-23  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

	* configure.in: Added "mr" for Marathi in ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-03-18  Gareth Owen  <gowen72@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in: Added en_GB to ALL_LINGUAS

2004-03-18  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

	* configure.in: Added "mr" for Marathi in ALL_LINGUAS.

Mon Mar 15 10:22:30 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.6.0.0

	* docs/Makefile.am: fix build

	* Makefile.am: did I not commit this build fix?

2004-03-15  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* configure.in, docs/Makefile.am: Add localized docs to build.
	* docs/*: Add de, es, fr, it, ja, ko, sv, zh_CN, zh_HK and zh_TW
	all from the Sun translation team.

Tue Mar 09 20:51:58 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: make DisplayLastLogin default
	  to 'false' since 'last' is stupid and non-localized, must make
	  our own version.  So this doesn't break 'code' freeze since it
	  doesn't change any code does it?

Thu Mar 04 11:08:42 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.5.90.2

	* Makefile.am: remove the sun gdmsetup-security fix as it was wrong
	  (probably was part of some other change)

Thu Mar 04 10:48:04 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Handle out of diskspace on making user
	  authentication better by first trying to wipe old xsession-errors
	  files for this user as that could in fact be the culprit and
	  usually frees up enough to write ~/.Xauthority.  We should try more
	  things, this is a crucial point which could render the machine
	  unusable on a simple out of diskspace error.

Thu Mar 04 10:18:40 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, daemon/slave.c: Apply patch from
	  vincent.berger@ext.bull.net (Vincent Berger), to make
	  /etc/environment work on AIX using setpenv.  Fixes #135401

	* daemon/slave.c: cosmetic cleanup

	* daemon/errorgui.c: fix the reading of the session errors file
	  again.  Not critical, but we were showing just the first line.
	  DOH!

Mon Mar 01 08:25:45 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: remove en_DK, will add after string freeze.
	  Not a string that is actually displayed, I was just adding it to
	  the translation matrix

Mon Mar 01 08:21:37 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am: Patch from Glynn Foster to fix installation of
	  gdmsetup-security

Sun Feb 29 10:30:35 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.[ch]:
	  While investigating speed issues with language dialog make init
	  lazy and show the dialog before filling it with stuff to make it
	  seem like something is happening.

Sun Feb 29 10:02:51 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Make gdm know about en_DK

2004-02-25  Danilo Šegan  <dsegan@gmx.net>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c (languages): 

	* config/locale.alias: Add Canadian English (fixes #135053) --
	patch by Adam Weinberger <adamw@freebsd.org>.

2004-02-25  Danilo Šegan  <dsegan@gmx.net>

	* config/locale.alias: Add Serbian variants (#135232).

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c (languages): Added Serbian variants (#135232).

Tue Feb 24 14:44:29 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: lookup if we have code.enc@mod, try
	  code@mod after code.enc@mod and before code.enc and code
	  addresses #135232

2004-02-21  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "en_CA" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Fri Feb 20 10:03:42 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* display.c, server.[ch], slave.c: When restarting a server by
	  whacking it and starting it again, wait at least one second to
	  allow things to "settle".  If local display is busy try again once
	  in 2 secs before resorting to telling the user so.  Be much milder
	  in whacking X's lock files / sockets to avoid whacking actual
	  locks / sockets when displays are in fact busy and used, that is,
	  only whack locks / sockets when we in fact successfully started
	  a server.

THu Feb 19 Guntupalli Karunakar <karunakar@freedomink.org>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Fixes #134372, Hindi was incorrectly
	  written Bengali script instead of Devanagari script.

Thu Feb 12 11:49:20 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/gdm.[ch],
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c,
	  gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c: Fixup the theme changing.  Add keys
	  GtkTheme, AllowGtkThemeChange and GtkThemesToAllow to control
	  this behaviour better.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml, config/gdm.conf.in: Update for the above changes
	  adding the GtkTheme, AllowGtkThemeChange and GtkThemesToAllow
	  keys

Wed Feb 11  Muktha <muktha.narayan@wipro.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmsetup.c: Add support for
	  theming. Fixes #125070.

Sun Feb 08 14:11:41 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.5.90.1

Sun Feb 08 10:11:41 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, greeter/greeter_item.c:  Fix #133189 by whacking
	  changing the string for 12 hour format from %I to %l

Sun Feb 08 09:57:56 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Apply patch to fix #133191 from 
	  msuarezalvarez@arnet.com.ar (Mariano Suárez-Alvarez)

2004-02-04  Tomasz Kloczko <kloczek@pld.org.pl>

	* configure.in: Trival cleanup: remove AC_SUBST(CFLAGS),
	  AC_SUBST(CPPFLAGS) and AC_SUBST(LDFLAGS). This variables are
	  substed by default.

Tue Jan 29  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:  Fixed so that it accepts
	  key gestures with a timeout of <= 0 if n_times is 1.  This
	  makes sense since timeout is not used if n_times is less
	  than 2.

Sun Jan 25 15:49:53 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: minor cleanup

Tue Jan 23  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:  Fixed so that the state
	  is checked when KeyRelease events are processed.
	  Previously the code would think that a Control-G gesture
	  was made when only the "G" key was actually pressed.

Tue Jan 16  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* daemon/misc.c:
	  Fixed core dumping error that was causing the greeter
	  to crash on Solaris after entering the username.

Thu Jan 15 12:45:02 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, daemon/verify-(crypt|shadow).c:
	  Apply patch from Vincent Berger <vincent.berger@ext.bull.net>
	  to re-fix #123766 by clearing the ADMCHG token.

Thu Jan 15 12:35:45 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix #131389 where if the slave crashed the
	  login field was not cleared

Tue Jan 13 08:40:29 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c: Add sys/socket.h include to fix compilation
	  on freebsd, fixes #130963, thanks to Joe Marcus Clarke
	  <marcus@freebsd.org>

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c: Fix compilation
	  of the crypt and shadow compilation.  Fixes #131042

Thu Jan 08 10:23:32 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.5.90.0

Tue Jan 06 17:16:40 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* confiogure.in: fix INTLTOOL test

Tue Jan 06 17:06:42 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/*/*: remove the xml.in files and readd the .xml
	  files.  There are no translations done anymore.

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/misc.[ch],
	  daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-pam.c,
	  daemon/verify-shadow.c: Add support for displaying last login
	  information if daemon/DisplayLastLogin is set (default to true).
	  Fixes #128940

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c:  The 'user already
	  logged in' (double login warning) dialog thingie should only be
	  shown AFTER all verification is done (as it does for PAM setups)

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update for DisplayLastLogin

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: the RetryDelay is annoying at 3
	  now that it works.  Set it to 1.

Tue Jan 06 16:06:12 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: the console/vt check for check_for_users
	  was completely wrong

Tue Jan 06  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c,
	  gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:  Moved include of vicious.h 
	  before gnome.h because gnome.h causes macros to be defined
	  for dcgettext, dgettext, gettext, textdomain, bindtextdomain.
	  And this causes a conflict with Solaris libintl.h which is
	  included by locale.h which is included by vicious.h.
 
Tue Jan 06 11:49:29 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c,
 	  daemon/xdmcp.c:  Fix #125064 by correctly reading out the chooser
	  output and ignoring all but the last line.

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: Send a newline BEFORE the chosen host as well
	  as after.  Also fix reading the address on hosts that have IPV6,
	  but that don't use it.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: Get rid of evil 'foo == FALSE'
	  kind of test

	* gui/modules/Makefile.am, gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c,
	  gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:  Link with ve so that we can use it
	  and ensure that our BINDIR is in the PATH.

Tue Jan 06 10:17:41 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: small leak fix

	* daemon/slave.c: make greeter restarting on notify smarter and
	  also restart the greeter when the modules stuff changed

	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c, gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c:
	  Fix #125153 by changing to busy cursor for 2 seconds after
	  launching something.

	* daemon/verify-shadow.c, daemon/verify-crypt.c: loginrestrictions
	  doesn't use glib to allocate the message (AIX only)

Mon Jan 05 23:35:55 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: apply patch from #123199
	  to allow double click on language to select it.  Patch by 
	  Kirk Mitchener <kmitchener@idc.com>

Mon Jan 05 23:30:38 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/misc.[ch],
	  daemon/getvt.[ch]:  Add QUERY_VT and SET_VT commands that handle
	  the VT's on linux.  This is because not all console logins will
	  actually own /dev/console.  When we change to a VT that we own,
	  also twiddle the cursor to turn off any screensaver or tickle
	  the xscreensaver lock dialog etc...

	* gui/gdmcomm.c: handle displays with the screen thingie set
	  correctly (that is whack the screen part, GDM is not interested
	  in it).

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Fix #127038 by presenting a list of already
	  logged in users / open displays (on the console).  This code may
	  be useful to steal for other such switchers.

	* daemon/cookie.c: don't read root's mail to get entropy, that may
	  be evil actually.

Fri Jan 02 16:31:34 2004  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/PreSession.in: fix bad color string

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add full path to the default list of modules
	  comment

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: don't use the pam_fail_delay but rather the
	  fallback only.  The fail delay will block at bad times when we
	  don't want it too.

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: save the config after flicking the accessibility
	  modules setting and set default path on the sounds thing
	  to /usr/share/sounds, even though it doesn't work because the
	  stupid GnomeFileEntry is broken!  Will file a bug/fix it later.

2004-01-03  Robert Sedak  <robert.sedak@sk.htnet.hr>

	* configure.in: Added "hr" in ALL_LINGUAS.

Thu Jan 01 11:24:30 2004  Ray Strode <halfline@hawaii.rr.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c (handle_user_message): Fix bug where
	REBOOT would get written to the socket before the separator
	when user queries available logout actions.

Thu Jan 01 10:39:00 2004  Ray Strode <halfline@hawaii.rr.com>

	* gui/gdmcomm.c (gdmcomm_get_display): Plug small leak.

Wed Dec 31 09:57:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am: add the OrigTree.pm file here to make intltool happy

Tue Dec 30 15:34:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/auth.c:  Complain on some more errors

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmcommon.[ch], gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade),
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h,
	  daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: Make the login sound thingie
	  configurable and make it possible to play an arbitrary sound with
	  /usr/bin/play (or whatever else is configured).  Add accessibility
	  section to gdmsetup which configures the accessibility modules
	  and the sound.  Fixes #125487

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade: Fix #120639 by indenting the chooser and
	  config toggles

	* config/gdm.conf.in, docs/C/gdm.xml:  Update docs for the
	  accessibility/sound stuff

Mon Dec 29 16:52:32 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: add SET_SAFE_LOGOUT_ACTION which is like schedule
	  for kdm.  Also implement the logout action in a cleaner fashion
	  without resorting to the DIRTY_SERVERS hacky thingie.

	* configure.in, docs/C/gdm.xml, daemon/gdm.h: set version to 2.5.90.0
	  since it's really for gnome 2.5 not 2.4

Thu Dec 04 17:01:21 2003  Leena Gunda <leena.gunda@wipro.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c:
	  pass the time in microseconds to pam_fail_delay().
	  Fixes bug #128507

Fri Dec 19 17:04:31 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/PreSession.in, config/gdm.conf.in: Make
	  default color #76848F to fix #128220.  Also in the PreSession
	  script try to grab the color from the gdm.conf file when
	  doing the xsetroot.

Fri Dec 19 16:50:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/auth.c, daemon/misc.c:
	  Lots of general paranoia stemming from fixing #127780.  Make sure
	  that the NEVER_FAILS_ eid/uid setting never actually fails by just
	  setting euid root before doing anything and such.

Fri Dec 19 15:44:03 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h, daemon/verify-(crypt|shadow).c: Massage
	  and then apply a patch from Vincent Berger
	  <vincent.berger@ext.bull.net> to add password expiration and
	  checking in the crypt/shadow code, at least on AIX.  Fixes
	  #123766

Fri Dec 19 15:30:31 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: remove the default size setting on the file
	  chooser to fix bug #129116

Fri Dec 19 12:28:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: protect the sys/sockio.h include with
	  the HAVE_SYS_SOCKIO_H define check to fix compilation on linux

Fri Dec 19 12:22:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/*.c, gui/*.c: use VE_IGNORE_EINTR instead
	  of IGNORE_EINTR and use this on more calls which can still
	  apparently fail with EINTR on completely braindead systems.
	  EINTR is evil.  It is PURE EVIL I tell you!

Mon Dec 17  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* configure.in
	Now use -lresolv when building on Solaris so that inet_aton can be
	found.

Mon Dec 15  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c:
	Add include of <sys/sockio.h> which is needed on Solaris in order
	to reference SIOCGIFCONF and SIOCGIFFLAGS.

Fri Dec 12 17:56:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, docs/C/gdm.xml:
	  add a GO fifo SOP command and a --wait-for-go command line option.
	  This is intended to allow an initialization script to start X
	  early and have that be the GDM display, but not allow users to
	  log in until it's ready.

Fri Dec 12 17:14:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in, docs/C/gdm.xml: There's now the ability to
	  reap flexiservers that are inactive for a period of time.  The
	  default time is 5 minutes.

	* gui/gdmcomm.c: add the new error codes (7 and 200) to the error
	  message table

Fri Dec 12 09:36:34 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>
 
	* gui/gdmcomm.c: check ownership of /tmp/.gdm_socket before using

Wed Dec 10 18:40:48 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: append a '!' to the action which was previously
	  selected (if one was)

Wed Dec 10 15:44:53 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: require gtk 2.3

	* Apply following patch from bugzilla to fix #128668

	2003-12-06  Jan Arne Petersen  <jpetersen@uni-bonn.de>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: (install_response), (install_new_theme): replace
	  GtkFileSelection with GtkFileChooser.

Wed Dec 10 15:36:31 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c: Fix #126465 where xdmcp_sessions would not
	  get decremented on normal logout.  Doh!  Just do a recount of
	  all the limits on display dispose that is just a lot more robust.

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: minor cosmetic cleanup

Wed Dec 10 13:08:13 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm-net.[ch],
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/xdmcp.c:  Add possibility to request
	  logout action to happen when the display dies using the SUP socket
	  protocol.  Very loosely based on a patch from Jarno Gassenbauer,
	  but simplified and not having a DoS and/or authentication leak
	  as the original patches do.  The commands are named different to
	  avoid naming conflict.

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in, docs/C/gdm.xml,
	  config/Makefile.am, gdm.spec.in: move the built in sessions to
	  a more appropriate place (datadir)

	* gui/gdmcommon.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter*.c: move some common utility functions to
	  a common sublibrary (renamed the language lib to libgdmcommon),
	  should cut down a little on the code duplication.  Needs more.

	* gui/gdmcommon.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  docs/C/gdm.xml, daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in: Apply a patch
	  from Anton Altaparmakov to add an optional info message to the
	  greeters.  Fixes #125219

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: fix RH #97716 by putting up a dialog when user
	  tries to input root for the first time

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: minor updates.

	* daemon/gdm.c: GdmStandardXServer can now have arguments (we used
	  to parse them, but if there were arguments, sanity checks would
	  fail making it not work), so no real change in how it works, it
	  just accepts more inputs

Wed Dec 10 2003 Archana Shah <archana.shah@wipro.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: Add documentation for Multicast and Multicast_Addr. 

Fri Dec 09 2003 Archana Shah <archana.shah@wipro.com>

	* configure.in : Put check for getaddrinfo, inet_ntop and structure
	  sockaddr_storage.

	  (gdm_xdmcp_send_unwilling), (gdm_xdmcp_send_accept),
	  (gdm_xdmcp_send_decline), (gdm_xdmcp_send_refuse ),
	  (gdm_xdmcp_send_failed), (gdm_xdmcp_send_alive),
	  gdm_xdmcp_send_managed_forward), (gdm_xdmcp_host_allow),
	  (gdm_forward_query_alloc), (gdm_forward_query_lookup):
	  All these functions will receive sockaddr_storage type argument if
	  IPv6 is enabled on the system.
	  (gdm_xdmcp_whack_queued_managed_forwards6),
	  (gdm_xdmcp_send_got_managed_forward6),
	  (gdm_xdmcp_display_alloc6), (gdm_xdmcp_displays_from_host6),

	  (have_ipv6): Function added to check run-time IPv6 support.
	  (gdm_xdmcp_init), (gdm_xdmcp_decode_packet):
	  These functions are modified to deal with IPv6 addresses as well.

	  A global variable of type in6_addr is added.
	  (gdm_chooser_host_alloc), (gdm_host_known), (is_loopback_addr),
	  (gdm_addr_known), (gdm_chooser_decode_packet),
	  (gdm_chooser_find_bcaddr), (do_ping),
	  (gdm_chooser_xdmcp_discover), (gdm_chooser_add_hosts),
	  (gdm_chbooser_xdmcp_init), (gdm_chooser_choose_host), (add_check),
	  (gdm_chooser_add_host), (gdm_chooser_parse_config):
	  Changed so that they all can deal IPv6 addresses.
	  (gdm_chooser_find_mcaddr): Function added to set the multicast
	  address.

	  (have_ipv6): Added function to check for run time IPV6 support.
	  (gte_free_display): Changed for IPv6.

Thu Nov 06 09:51:45 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: whack some stale code, mark some messages for translation

	* daemon/slave.c: whack all clients inside the session stop.  Should
	  "fix" #126071 although I don't see a clean way to fix that.
	  There's always a race as clients could still not be all dead by the
	  time we call close session.  But perhaps this helps matters a bit.

Fri Oct 17 10:54:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.4.5

Fri Oct 17 10:40:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c:  Apply patch
	  from Frederic Crozat <fcrozat@mandrakesoft.com> to make gecos 
	  into utf8 before displaying it in the face browser.

	* daemon/auth.c: make sure that umask 077 before reopening the
	  .Xauthority since apparently it can happen that the file doesn't
	  exist then.

Thu Oct 16 09:55:55 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.4.4

	* config/shell-extract.sh: fix extracting of text from
	  shell scripts.

Thu Oct 16 09:13:48 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/gdm-net.[ch]: Make the socket connection
	  non-blocking and limit conversations to 20 requests.  Also
	  cut lines short at 4096.  Fixes CAN-2003-0793 and CAN-2003-0794
	  respectively.

	* daemon/slave.c: fix #123958 by clearing the message after
	  authentication is done for the configurator.

	* daemon/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/Makefile.am, gui/Makefile.am,
	  gui/modules/Makefile.am:  The disable_deprecated defines should
	  only be on for conformance testing I suppose.  Fixes #124680

Wed Oct 15 14:19:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item.c: the rich string parsing routine was
	  broken if the underline was for the last letter.  Fixes bug
	  discussed in rh #106189

Sun Oct 12 05:55:20 2003  Richard Allen <ra@ra.is>

	* Added is.po

Fri Oct 10 13:58:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: forgot to add -audit 0 to Xnest

Fri Oct 10 13:53:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: avoid possible dos by turning
	  off all audit trails in the X server on standard
	  config. (use "-audit 0" command line)

Thu Oct 09 11:11:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c: fix the line breaking not to
	  crash, though it is still horrible.  It is in fact now an even
	  more horrible hack.

Mon Oct 06 15:02:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/auth.c, daemon/slave.c:
	  touch auth files in /tmp every 12 hours so that
	  they don't get whacked by tmpwatch.  Also add an
	  option to short circuit the NFS test option to
	  allow cookies on NFS (NeverPlaceCookiesOnNFS)

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: Display dialog about not
	  being able to load the theme even when not running
	  in debug mode.  So that missing/bad themes don't
	  just look like greeter crashes (see rh #106189 for
	  people getting confused by bad spec file)

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add the NeverPlaceCookiesOnNFS
	  key

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: add info about NeverPlaceCookiesOnNFS

Fri Oct 03 14:03:31 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c: include <signal.h> to fix build
	  on solaris

Fri Oct 03 13:40:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c: when the ~/.Xauthority didn't exist
	  and we tried to create it but failed due to root
	  squashing, whack the file (we created as user, but
	  can't access it as root).

Mon Sep 29 14:32:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/PreSession.in, config/PostSession.in, config/XKeepsCrashing,
	  config/Xsession.in:  Be more careful with shell stuff and quote
	  whatever we can, should fix rh #105858.

	* daemon/misc.c, config/XKeepsCrashing: Don't use gdialog as it's
	  nowdays just a wrapper on zenity

Fri Sep 26 13:38:55 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: in a further fit of strictness, stat the file
	  even before handing it to the greeter and don't allow other
	  then regular files.

Fri Sep 26 10:44:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: to be even more strict about filenames of user pics,
	  first run through realpath first.

Thu Sep 25 15:42:20 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.4.3

Thu Sep 25 15:38:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/getvt.c: add a little color to the logout
	  message, correctly set the fonts here.  remove the stupid
	  /bin/clear hack and the /bin/chvt hack and replace it with
	  actual code.  Plus a teeny bit of cleanup

	* utils/gdmopen.c: some minor cleanup

	* configure.in: raise version

Thu Sep 25 11:23:24 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/slave.c: be even more strict
	  about the setuid stuff here (it can't actually fail, but
	  just in case, we're being paranoid)  Also reset the
	  environment and desetuid for the setup program even
	  though that's not really needed.

Thu Sep 25 10:37:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/filecheck.[ch], daemon/gdm.[ch],
	  daemon/misc.c, daemon/slave.c:  Auditing the file handling
	  stuff, increase general paranoia and code strictness about
	  these things plus check pretty much every return of the
	  sete[ug]id even though they are pretty much guaranteed
	  to exist.  Being paranoid here is good.  Allow the
	  authentication cookie be given in upper case hex for
	  the socket protocol.

Wed Sep 24 18:01:06 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: add some extra strictness to the slave when looking
	  at the session name supplied in .dmrc, and also be careful about
	  what we read as the user pic.

Wed Sep 24 16:34:02 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c, gui/greeter/greeter_geometry.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.[ch]: rework the text wrapping
	  stuff.  Now we use pango to figure out where breaks should be
	  and then do a pretty stupid algorithm to break the string at
	  the requested length.  This works better it seems and isn't
	  perhaps on as much crack as messing with the canvas text items
	  pango layout.  It's still on crack however.

Wed Sep 24 13:21:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: don't exec chooser/greeter in shell that's kind of
	  evil and resets too many env vars.  Instead reset to the original
	  env first and then setup our env vars and exec the greeter or
	  chooser.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_events.c, gui/greeter/greeter_geometry.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_customlist.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c, gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:
	  Fix bug #123017 with use of evil hacks (as if the original
	  text code was not evil). Check max-width and
	  max-screen-percent-width attributes for label pos elements.
	  Wrap text if it goes over it's width or the max-width
	  (Mental note: the greeter layout stuff is on complete crack
	  and should be rewritten with great prejudice).  Also while
	  at it save an extra 112 bytes off every element by using
	  more appropriate types and some unions, adds up to about
	  5k for Bluecurve so it's not much actually.  Also fix
	  the enriched string parsing to understand \n just like
	  gdmlogin does

	* gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml.in,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml.in,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/happygnome.xml.in:
	  For some reason the canvas now gives me larger fonts, so
	  use smaller fonts and tweak the layout a bit.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update the docs a bit

Tue Sep 23 10:16:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/gdmthemetester: fix shell parse error

	* gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c, gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:
	  parse and use font and color info for the entry types.  The
	  documentation is unclear but would sort of imply this is 
	  possible.  Plus it is good for making large font themes.
	  Based on a patch from: Anton Altaparmakov <aia21@cam.ac.uk>

Mon Sep 22 15:37:03 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.4.2

Mon Sep 22 15:35:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/misc.[ch]: add a func to get a specific
	  stored env var.  Check in the stored PATH for TryExec and
	  only check TryExec when finding a session when nothing else
	  is given.  The greeters really take care of TryExec.

Mon Sep 22 15:19:21 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gnome.desktop.in: add TryExec=gnome-session

Mon Sep 22 15:16:05 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Makefile.am: in the old location where we're not replacing
	  the files, move them rather then just copy them to avoid duplicate
	  copies.  Also just append the .orig extension, we handle that
	  now

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: Fix the extension
	  handling checking and default.desktop.rpmorig and such won't be
	  treated as .desktop files anymore

Mon Sep 22 15:01:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in: use $datadir/xsessions instead of
	  hardcoding /usr/share/xsessions

	* config/Makefile.am: install gnome.desktop and CDE.desktop into the
	  datadir location as they're not config and this way we share them
	  with KDM, yay.  They should be installed by respective owner
	  packages at some point though ...

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update a bit.

Mon Sep 22 13:55:50 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c: fix error handling / leaks

	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c: fix error handling and leaks,
	  fix the stupid and annoying as hell "turn of key-repeat" hack,
	  fix using modifier keys as the gestures themselves (#122944)

	* gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in: fix documentation a bit

	* daemon/errorgui.c: listen to all events on the dialogs to
	  make the accessibility gestures work

Mon Sep 22 12:25:44 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c: re-enable the gtk modules stuff, it wasn't
	  linkage issues but in fact not setting stuff like $HOME properly.

	* daemon/misc.c: unset SIGABRT, SIGXFSZ and SIGXCPU in
	  gdm_unset_signals else bad things happen (as I found out by
	  the modules excersise)
	  
	* daemon/slave.c: kill unused var warning.

Mon Sep 22 11:25:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: catch exit code 1 from greeter as fail error

	* daemon/errorgui.c: disable the gtk modules loading, this is broken
	  due to bonobo non-linkage here, will need to reevaluate linkage
	  all over wrt a11y.  Also catch when the dialog dies and try again
	  first with no themes then with absolutely no modules as well.

Mon Sep 22 10:20:56 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c: add the gtk modules to error dialogs, so
	  that accessibility works there as well.

	* daemon/slave.c: Look in ~/.face and ~/.face.icon to get faces set
	  by KDM.  Also a bit of cleanup in the face reading routine.

Mon Sep 22 10:03:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: Fix
	  session masking by path in the greeters and rework the 'Desktop'
	  -> 'desktop' migration code to be correct and simpler (migrate
	  where we read from the ~/.dmrc)

Sat Sep 20 09:32:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: test for defsess and
	  savedsess in testing for switchdesk mode default rather then
	  'default.desktop'

Fri Sep 19 18:59:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: fix rh bug #104287,
	  The default session is not 'Xclients.desktop' but
	  'default.desktop'.  Also don't talk of 'switchdesk' if
	  /usr/bin/switchdesk is not around.

Fri Sep 19 18:00:37 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Launch the greeter from a shell so that we get
	  a nice environment.  This is needed for both TryExec in the
	  sessions and for finding things in the path for the accessibility
	  modules

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: select all events on the login window, this will
	  catch all events so that the modules get them

	* gui/modules/AccessDwellMouseEvents.in,
	  gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in: update the docs here and
	  use the path.  Also change <Mouse0> to <Mouse1>.  And make
	  it 4 times 4 seconds. to get gok.  1 time is annoying as hell.
	  Also add the same for <Mouse3> as that may be for a left handed
	  person.

	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c, gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:
	  cleanups to both modules, fix it so that sequences aren't 1
	  longer in the key mouse listener, also don't kill the events.
	  it does kill a lot of real events, especially if we use the mouse
	  events.  We just have to deal with the mouse doing something.
	  We can't decide if it was a gesture until after it was done,
	  which means we're really out of luck.  Fixes #122658

Fri Sep 19 15:34:36 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmcomm.c,
 	  gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c,
	  gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/greeter/greeter.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: Use the new ve_hig_dialog_new
	  interface to set the markup flag where appropriate fixing
	  #122683

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.c: convert filenames
	  to utf8 before displaying them.

Fri Sep 19 13:41:37 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Makefile.am, config/default.desktop.in:  Rename
	  'Default.desktop' to 'default.desktop' for KDM compatibility
	  since default session is now marked by 'default'

	* config/gdm.conf.in: update the path after discussion with
	  the KDM maintainer

	* daemon/gdm.h: update the session path.

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c:
	  minor cleanup and make sure that 'Default' gets rewritten
	  to 'default' as it should be.  'default' will actually work
	  with the previous version of gdm so it's quite OK.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml:  Update the session docs to reflect reality,
	  plus some other minor cleanup

	* po/POTFILES.in: s/Default/default/

Thu Sep 18 17:41:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c: Fix the parser to use strtok
	  and make it buffer overflow safe.

	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c: skip initial whitespace from
	  service

Thu Sep 18 17:23:21 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c: fixed underflow with start
	  position.  Fix the parser to use strtok and make it buffer overflow
	  safe.  Plus various other cleanups and fixes.  Fixes #122616


Thu Sep 18 16:20:07 2003  David Bolter <david.bolter@utoronto.ca>

	* gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in: added gok gestures for
	direct mode

	* gui/modules/AccessDwellMouseEvents.in: added a gok gesture for
	dwell mode


Thu Sep 18 16:15:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h, daemon/slave.c: apply the SELinux patch,
	  taking care not to break the string freeze.

Thu Sep 18 13:53:37 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: update version

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: treat SessionDesktopDir
	  as a PATH type variable using the first element.  This
	  will allow full interoperability with upcoming KDM
	  without sacrificing backcompat for GDM itself.  Also
	  it will be easier to change the dir in the future
	  this way.

	* config/gdm.conf.in: update for the path stuff

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update for the path stuff

Thu Sep 18 03:33:44 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/cookie.c: Can't sleep, so re-clean the random
	  stuff.  This time really think about what's happening and document
	  the random tick stuff.  The random tick is now a lot faster too
	  after browsing the MT pseudorandom thing, what we were doing before
	  was just slow (not that slow, we're talking 'too slow for
	  sopwith').  But it was kind of embarrassing I suppose.  I need to
	  think about such code before I use it.  Also really get all the
	  entropy we can get from the current time instead of just around
	  20 lousy bits.  So we need less ticks to get better entropy.

Wed Sep 17 10:14:27 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: the sessions dir is now commented out so that
	  we take the default rather then what's in the file by default.

Fri Sep 12 15:32:07 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.4.1

Fri Sep 12 15:29:05 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/cookie.c: a little bit of cleanup in the
	  random number department

Fri Sep 12 14:49:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version

	* daemon/gdm-net.c: some cleanup and be utterly strict when
	  creating /tmp/.gdm_socket
	  (note: we were strict before, but now we're really REALLY strict)

	* daemon/gdm.c: disable substituting 'nobody' for 'gdm', what was I
	  smoking when I wrote that?

	* daemon/misc.c: some cleanup and make sure gdm_fdprintf writes all
	  the characters it really needs to write.  Also the ensure extension
	  doesn't append extensions to empty strings.

	* daemon/slave.c: use only one pipe for all the waitpids, since we
	  really don't need more then one and this make code simpler.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update

Thu Sep 11 16:11:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add comment about ShowLastSession

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, daemon/misc.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: Work with the session setup
	  as implemented now in KDM.  Doesn't add the built in default,
	  custom, failsafe sessions to the greeters themselves though
	  yet, and doesn't change the default session path (will change
	  to /etc/X11/sessions from /etc/X11/dm/Sessions)

	* daemon/gdm.c: minor cleanup

Tue Sep 02 12:11:39 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.4.0

Mon Sep 01 14:01:02 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: move gdm_verify_cleanup after running of
	  PostSession and touching the home dir.  Home dir may be
	  unmounted in pam_close_session leading to failures when
	  trying to touch the home dir in the PostSession script
	  and in the code that closes the session.

	* daemon/auth.c: fix error output so that bug reports wouldn't
	  point me to the wrong code.

Tue Aug 26 18:06:51 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: minor update

Tue Aug 26 17:58:46 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: lots of updates, stylistic and fixing
	  errors, also add ShowLastSession.

	* configure.in: raise version number

	* config/Makefile.am: create log dir correctly

	* README: fixed non-sensical sentence

	* gdm.spec.in: make this work again

Mon Aug 25 16:48:20 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.2.102

Mon Aug 25 16:27:09 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/display.c:
	  if we can't use the file ~/.xsession-errors, try
	  /tmp/xses-<user>.XXXXXX using mkstemp.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update

	* NEWS: update

Mon Aug 25 13:55:09 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/auth.[ch], daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/server.c:
	  Server auth file now uses FamilyWild and we set up the different
	  access stuff for the user auth file.  Don't add FamilyInternet
	  stuff to the xauth file if we start the server with
	  "-nolisten tcp".  The purging is done right and doesn't
	  mistakenly whack entries we didn't add.

	* NEWS: update

Mon Aug 25 11:13:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: make insensitive the options which make no sense
	  in the security page when actions menu is off.  Partly fixes
	  #120639, the other part can be fixed after UI freeze is off.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update the SystemMenu (Actions menu) key
	  description.

Mon Aug 25 10:47:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c: if the .Xauthority would be empty, just
	  unlink the file.  That is nicer to systems with quotas.

	* daemon/slave.c: It appears some people are not letting
	  us redirect the ~/.xsession-errors and close the pipe
	  for us and we weren't handling EOF correctly (and ran
	  into a very tight loop then).  This fixes #120580.
	  Also fix select usage, and fix some minor bugs with
	  respect to returns from the read calls.  Also catch
	  and handle the XFSZ signal to avoid abrupt logouts when
	  evil limits are set.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: updates relating to the ~/.xsession-errors
	  stuff and how to handle the Xsession file.

Fri Aug 22 16:11:15 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/auth.c, daemon/filecheck.c, daemon/gdm.c,
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c: construct files properly using
	  g_build_filename, add a utility for this gdm_make_filename if
	  we want to build out of dir, name and extension.  Fixes
	  bug #118040

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c: remove unused variable

Fri Aug 22 13:19:05 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* AUTHORS: update to be correct UTF-8

Thu Aug 21 14:35:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/gdm.1: add a very simple man page

Thu Aug 21 14:10:44 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: add --version option to fix #120409

Thu Aug 21 14:05:09 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in: Add System to categories to partly fix
	  #120360.  We can't add Settings as that would break the spec
	  as spec says settings are only for desktop settings and not
	  for system setup.

Wed Aug 20 18:55:06 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* AUTHORS: update, haven't done so in a while

Wed Aug 20 13:21:48 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.2.101

Wed Aug 20 12:13:04 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: sync some defaults and make
	  lots of keys commented out in the standard config file so that
	  we can change the defaults later without users having to
	  install a new config file.

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/cookie.c: Use glib's random functions
	  instead of rand where we need those pesky pseudorandom
	  numbers

	* daemon/slave.c: cleanup for greeter restarting

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: a bit of cleanup and set tmp_PAM_USER
	  to login if login is set, just in case pam is weird.

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: when not running from within gdm itself
	  display "ghelp:gdm" on help

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: minor updates

Mon Aug 18 17:33:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: cleanup and fix the signal blocking,
	  plus abort when we receive a bad opcode since otherwise we pretty
	  much just hang.

	* daemon/auth.c: don't add entries twice

Mon Aug 18 13:56:14 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/cookie.c: add more fallbacks in case of /dev/random and
	  friends not being around, also use the last cookie generated in the
	  checksum and spot check the data we get from the files for
	  randomness (for example /dev/audio might just give us zeros), also
	  read 1024 bytes from the files.

Mon Aug 18 11:02:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/server.c, daemon/xdmcp.c:
	  To prevent a possible DoS attack where an app might spit out
	  too many warnings on stdout/stderr and thus fill up the users
	  home dir (or when an app is buggy), the output of the session
	  no longer goes directly into .xsession-errors but in fact
	  through an internal pipe.  This way we can just cap the file
	  at some size (currently 80*2500 bytes, which should be long
	  enough for actual use in debugging but it's short enough to
	  prevent a DoS attack)

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: note about the above

	* daemon/cookie.c: skip the first 16megs of /dev/mem only on
	  i386

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/cookie.c: some cleanup with the IGNORE_EINTR macro

Sat Aug 16 08:47:45 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/cookie.c: hell we only need 16 bytes of random data from
	  /dev/random, (or /dev/srandom) we don't want to waste kernel
	  entropy.  16 bytes of randomness is all we need.

Fri Aug 15 18:32:54 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c: handle NULL addresses, purge by number and name,
	  not by number and address

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/gdm.c: Correctly handle out of diskspace
	  errors on auth files and on the PID file

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.c: fix the runlevel checking code.
	  It's popen, not fopen.  DOH!

	* daemon/misc.c: use 16 lines of output for text dialogs, since
	  some of the strings we use are quite long.

Fri Aug 15 12:36:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: added more notes on the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
	  authorization scheme

	* configure.in: raise version

	* daemon/cookie.c: use xor instead of + for the seed since it
	  looks more technical and makes it perhaps a little bit more
	  random (depending on how long 'long' is)

Fri Aug 15 12:14:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/cookie.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/gdm.c:
	  Add some semi randomness spinners which are spun on somewhat random
	  occasions.  This should add to our entropy a bit especially on
	  systems without /dev/random (20 bytes of semi randomness is added
	  this way).  And try /dev/srandom on openbsd.

	* daemon/cookie.c: don't read the buffer max from /dev/random, but
	  only the required size, the (there's no need to md5 512 bytes of
	  truly random data just to get 16 bytes).  Require 32 bytes from
	  /dev/random (this is what openssl does apparently), also from
	  openssl, /dev/random still sometimes blocks, so set up a select
	  loop for it that waits 10ms at most.  Also try /dev/mem as one of
	  the files in case we can't get enough entropy from /dev/random.

	* daemon/slave.c: some G_UNLIKELY/G_LIKELY code from yesterday
	  that was still uncommitted

	* daemon/auth.c: set egid as well as euid when testing for root
	  squashing

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: add some IGNORE_EINTR

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: make sure the ARRAY8's are initialized
	  to zero so that we don't possibly crash on bad return packet.

Fri Aug 15  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* daemon/misc.h: Provide a #define for __PRETTY_FUNCTION__
	  for systems where it is not available.

Fri Aug 15 01:59:53 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c: fix possible crash on on purge and redo the
	  purge reopening to be more strict

	* daemon/slave.c: fix some possible fd leaks

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/xdmcp.c: Implement our own asserts that do
	  gdm_fail

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/xdmcp.c, gui/greeter/greeter_events.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:  Go crazy with G_LIKELY
	  and G_UNLIKELY.  It's 1:50am, I can't sleep and am bored.
	  Might as well do some optimizations.

Thu Aug 14 17:50:30 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c: The UserAuthDir is treated just like /tmp when
	  no tilde expansion is used.  Without that it is kind of useless.
	  Also try to detect a nfs home directory by trying to open file
	  for reading in it as root, and if we can't use the fallback
	  directory.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml:  Update docs for UserAuthDir and add a note about
	  using this with NFS mounted home directories.

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add note about UserAuthDir

Thu Aug 14 14:45:42 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c, gui/greeter/greeter_events.c:
	  whack the button lookup, we can just setup a "my_button" pointer
	  when parsing avoiding tree traversal up to root on every event

	* gui/greeter/greeter_geometry.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:  Notice that we never use the
	  orig_pixbufs, so we completely whack them, also we try to avoid
	  hitting the disk all the time for pixmaps, if we have already
	  loaded them elsewhere just use a cached copy.  This all won't
	  work right if we would allocate items several times but we never
	  do.  The above change seems to save about 6megs of memory for
	  circles (and other themes with larger pixmaps around)

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c: By clever use of bitfields and
	  reordering the items in the info structure, reduce the size of the
	  info structure by 72 bytes on x86 at least, this saves about 2.5k
	  for the Bluecurve theme.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_events.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.h,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c: don't change state for things
	  that don't have the other states defined, and don't do the
	  state change stuff for items that only have the normal state.
	  Saves quite a bit of CPU grinding that was going on for constant
	  updates.

Thu Aug 14 11:36:45 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c: Save status of the last session
	  process, and use code 66 to mean do not display the "session
	  crashed" error box.  Use the 66 error code from the session
	  code when we know the session has not had problems starting,
	  and where we told the user what was wrong.  Also move
	  parent_exists to avoid compiler warning and assume "once dead,
	  always dead".

Thu Aug 14 09:55:31 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: Limit number of
	  users to display at 500, but also limit the time it takes to get
	  them by 5 seconds.  Whatever we can read in 5 seconds we get.

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: similarly as above but cap the number of users at
	  100 since more then that is kind of useless in the combo box.

Wed Aug 13 11:17:15 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: when the parent process doesn't exist,
	  we die after session ended.  This is a semi decent (not really,
	  but it's simple) way to handle the main daemon crashing.

Wed Aug 13 10:56:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c: try /dev/fd (FreeBSD equivalent of /proc/self/fd) as
	  well, and also ignore entries starting with '.', just in case.

Wed Aug 13  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: add check for fbconsole (fallback
	  (console)
	* daemon/server.c: add call to start fbconsole (if present)
	  after the Xserver starts.

Tue Aug 12 17:48:45 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: check operating system on startup

Mon Aug 11 09:38:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: whack a doubled paragraph.

Fri Aug 08 17:20:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: fill in missing info in the theme manual

	* gui/greeter/greeter_geometry.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.h,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:
	  respect negative coordinates with "-0", must store the
	  negativity in a flag for that.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c: break all pam messages at
	  50 columns, not just pam-error (actually those are not
	  all pam messages we just call them that)

	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c: parse "active" for text
	  items, not just prelight and normal.
	  
	* gui/greeter/greeter_item.c: fix typo in g_warning

Fri Aug 08 09:35:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.2.100

Thu Aug 07 17:59:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, config/gdm.conf.in: Remove
	  the SessionMaxFile key since it wasn't used anyway (we've killed
	  the GNOME session chooser).  Also fixup the comment on XDMCP
	  enabling.

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: add more comments on security of XDMCP, fixup
	  the screen sections a bit, whack SessionMaxFile entry

Wed Aug 06 17:40:27 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdmsetup-pam: don't use the paths but let pam find modules itself

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: limit number of
	  users at 100 (rather then 50) where it really becomes bad.  We need
	  to handle this in a nicer way.

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: make the globsessid default to rand() so that they
	  really differ from run to run, rather then just time(NULL).  check
	  tcp wrappers for managed_forward and got_managed_forward (just to
	  be strict), also check tcp wrappers on forward query, the Alive packet
	  now gets sent with real info rather then just whatever keepalive
	  sent us (and thus follows the spec).  Make sure the session id is
	  never zero as that can happen now.  Send at most one unwilling packet
	  per second, and try to defer doing any actual work until after
	  we checked with tcp wrappers.  Also add some more potential
	  debugging.

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: translate the lowercase "username:" and
	  "password:", some modules seem to be using those.

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, gui/gdmchooser.c: if the condition is not new
	  data to be read, don't try to run XdmcpFill

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: more notes on security of XDMCP and using
	  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 added, plus a section on the TCP Wrappers,
	  though it kind of sucks.

Wed Aug 06 12:05:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, docs/C/gdm.xml: update version number

Wed Aug 06 11:39:37 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: some fixes from my mailspool from like
	  a year ago, plus added section about terminal lab
	  example setups

Wed Aug 06  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* gui/Makefile.am: Remove any existing gdmXnest symbolic link before 
	  creating the new symbolic link.  Now make install doesn't fail
	  on Solaris when replacing an existing gdm2 install.

Mon Aug 04 15:05:26 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/choose.c: fix crash when indirect display expires

	* daemon/gdm.c: call gdm_ensure_sanity on startup as well, seems like
	  a good place to ensure sanity too

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: fix checking auth string, fix debug messages

Mon Aug 04 13:43:29 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c: Fixed #118878 by actually ensuring the /tmp/.ICE-unix
	  permissions.

Mon Aug 04 09:20:06 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm, config/gdm-autologin: Don't include the /lib/security
	  dir for the pam modules and just let pam locate things on its own

	* daemon/errorgui.[ch], daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c: Use the gtk
	  resource file for the greeters in the errorgui to get the same
	  GTK theme going here, instead of gdm run the post session error
	  dialog as the user for whom it is running, and run the post session
	  error dialog before the session stop again since the home dir might
	  not be present after the session stopped.

Fri Aug 01 11:19:50 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: the SIGABRT handler cannot use the mainloop as
	  it can never return.

Fri Aug 01 11:06:37 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.[ch]: first get initial rlimits and use those
	  when restoring limits.  Should fix errors where root limits
	  are set low and we jack them up uselessly or when someone
	  wants to limit the gdm process.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c: ignore SIGPWR, restart on
	  SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ, and cleanly exit on SIGABRT (which
	  could come from glib).  Slave only ignores SIGPWR
	  otherwise since we handle slave crashes properly.  Also
	  print error to the log rather then just debug when child
	  actually crashes, that's an error obviously.

Fri Aug  1 01:51:50 2003  Jordi Mallach <jordi@sindominio.net>

	* gui/gdmcomm.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c: fix typo. Missed the release...

Thu Jul 31 15:26:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: add the release info as the first paragraph of the
	  preface so that it appears in the HTML and PDF versions

Thu Jul 31 14:43:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.2.99

Thu Jul 31 13:50:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c: unset SIGINT as well in gdm_unset_signals

	* NEWS: update some more

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: fix closing tag

Thu Jul 31 12:58:26 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* XKeepsCrashing, daemon/verify-pam.c:  update comments

	* daemon/misc.c: fix leaks/crashes in the text message dialog stuff

	* daemon/slave.c: do a chdir as the user id again just for sanity
	  sake

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: don't load
	  more then 50 users into the user listing.  This should fix
	  random badness happening on large systems using things like NIS
	  (you shouldn't use face browser here anyway)

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: remove the use of redundant
	  _set_has_separator

	* NEWS: update 

Wed Jul 30 15:21:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: add gdk_beep to the Username
	  prompt, that way you know you can type.  Useful for blind people,
	  or people that are not watching their screen to see when the
	  computer finished booting.

Tue Jul 29 17:32:35 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: whack the gdk-pixbuf-2.0 req since we're including
	  gtk+ already, this apparently breaks compilation on older systems
	  Also fix the paths and handle case where X installed in
	  /opt/X11R6/bin

Tue Jul 29 16:39:51 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: fix the GNOME_COMPILE_WARNINGS and remove
	  GNOME_COMMON_INIT, fixes #118578

Tue Jul 29 14:35:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: no need to handle server dead condition specifically
	  for the unhandled case.  The pause call will exit and we'll notice
	  the servpid being 0 and exit.

	* NEWS: update

Tue Jul 29 12:15:54 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c: killall the xdmcp slaves first and
	  then wait for them en-masse.  This should make large xdmcp server
	  much faster when shutting gdm down.  Make races with the waitpid
	  stuff harder to happen.  In the worst case we wait 10 seconds.

	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c
	  daemon/verify-*.c: implement a sleep using select which doesn't
	  stop on signals (it restarts self), which is useful in a whole
	  bunch of places, and also avoids the alarm vs. sleep thing
	  which we were completely forgetting about.

Tue Jul 29 11:10:20 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c: apparently _SC_OPEN_MAX can be ridiculously high
	  sometimes (1024^2 on Linux 2.4 kernel if I understand it right).
	  closing all those FDs can take quite a bit of time.  So 1)
	  use /proc/self/fd/ directory if it exists and 2) limit the
	  maximum fd to 4096 as we really won't be using fds higher then
	  that I don't think.  We'll try an open in that case to see
	  if we are really very high in the number of fds

	* daemon/slave.c: fix xdmcp logins, the servpid will not be set
	  here even if the server is running.  DUH!  Also send XPID 0
	  before killing self just in case when we receive that
	  X died.

Mon Jul 28 16:28:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: fix doc of the gdm User/Group and add
	  a section on this to the Overview.

Mon Jul 28 14:10:12 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/*.c: for all functions for which I found in
	  the manpages that EINTR could be returned on at least some
	  systems, use a new IGNORE_EINTR macro which will ignore the EINTR
	  errno.  This should fix any bugs with signals coming at the
	  wrong times, though that is quite unlikely I'd say.  Apparently
	  SVr4 can return EINTR even for execv which is really strict since
	  EINTR is pretty much useless.  Why can't we all be sane like BSD.

	* daemon/misc.c, daemon/server.c: automatic vars have weird behaviour
	  when using Setjmp, so use static (volatile wouldn't work here if
	  I'm reading the docs right)

Mon Jul 28 10:36:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* confiugure.in, acconfig.h, daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.c:  check
	  for sched_yield in the standard lib and then in -lrt, and don't
	  use it if we can't find it.  Also remove its usage from places
	  where we're going to yield the processor very soon anyway.

Mon Jul 28 09:19:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: Fix #118404, we don't need TCP Wrappers if compiling
	  without XDMCP

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_timed.c: Apply patch from
	  Steve Chaplin to fix use of some deprecated functions #118361

	* config/Xsession.in: remove the 'no zenity' message and add an echo
	  when starting the failsafe session, even though in that case it's
	  unlikely there is a .xsession-errors unless something went wrong

Sat Jul 26 21:04:21 2003  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@redfoxcenter.org>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.desktop.in: Fixed a little typo.

Sat Jul 26 01:47:40 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c: the waitpid function doesn't work
	  as I expected with respect to signals so emulate it with either
	  sleep or pause and then a WNOHANG waitpid.  Also kill the
	  XKeepsCrashing thing if we get a SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGHUP,
	  just like with the slaves.  The slaves are now killed at least
	  once in 10 seconds in case they are hanging somewhere.

	* daemon/gdm.c: set up a TERM/INT handler for the first few moments,
	  which will kill the extra process if any in addition to exiting.

	* daemon/misc.c: fix the gdm_signal_default to use SIG_DFL and
	  not SIG_IGN, doh! and fix extra_process check a little

	* daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c: fix server start race that
	  could result in the USR1 to not set SERVER_RUNNING, and fix
	  slave not to try to open the display again if the server
	  is gone.

Fri Jul 25 19:01:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: minor cleanup of main

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/gdmchooser.c:
	  unification of some error messages to make translations simpler,
	  plus fixing bug #56654 finally hopefully by removing programmer
	  references from translatable strings

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/gdm.c: new functions
	  for ignoring or resetting to DFL of signals using sigaction.
	  In the main daemon ignore SIGPIPE and SIGUSR1, in the slave
	  ignore SIGPIPE and SIGUSR1 and set the mask before the setjmp.
	  also we just unmask some signals now instead of masking
	  everything. 

	* daemon/slave.c: accept DISPLAY_GREETERFAILED from a greeter

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: return DISPLAY_GREETERFAILED
	  on bad failures.

Fri Jul 25 17:46:11 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: fix C99/C++ism that gcc no longer warns about,
	  anywhere declarations C++ style

	* daemon/gdm.c: when reading with %02x use unsigned int

	* daemon/gdm-net.[ch]: the connection close_notify should be of
	  type GDestroyNotify

Fri Jul 25 17:09:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: apparently pam can be on crack and so the
	  best and apparently most theoretically portable (to different
	  module configs) way of handling the face browser is by resetting
	  the pam handle after a user has been selected.  This works just
	  as well and we dump any possibly dangerous state from the pam
	  handle's previous invocation of pam_authenticate.

Fri Jul 25 16:31:24 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c:  Fix updating the gdm_main_pid, which fixes gdm_fail
	  that is done after daemonification.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/verify-pam.c: Fix debian bug
	  194613 by adding an option --no-console which ignores the [servers]
	  section.  An empty [servers] section implies --no-console.  In this
	  mode the console will not be used (so no opening of text dialogs on
	  virtual terminals which just screws up XDMCP only headless servers)

	* daemon/slave.c: always send XPID after server_stop unless of course
	  we're just about to exit

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: add documentation of command line options

Fri Jul 25 13:06:49 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c: if child crashed (died of a signal)
	  then log the signal if debug is on

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.[ch]:  The X server
	  quite apparently emits a USR1 on re-init so catch that (apparently
	  I was not seeing this before as USR1 seems to have been blocked
	  during the fun times.)

	* demon/server.c: on exit from an XDMCP display whack all clients
	  to support broken X terminals

	* daemon/slave.c: whack the \n's from some of the GUI messages as
	  that's not needed anymore with gtk2 and in fact sometimes
	  can look bad.

	* daemon/slave.c: run session_stop before the 10 second session
	  warning and don't run the warning if the server is dead

	* daemon/veriy-pam.c: don't return uninit value if we don't
	  open session or delete secred, return PAM_SUCCESS

	* daemon/gdmthemetester: add -terminate to command line so that
	  I don't keep getting thousands of Xnest windows on my screen

Fri Jul 25 03:32:48 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c: whack unneeded block pushes, when killing child
	  rekill if we get a SIGTERM, if the slave crashes during unmanage
	  kill its children.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c: use sched_yield at the right places
	  where we expect the other process to do work.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/misc.c:
	  handle interrupts on writes/reads and use PIPE_BUF to limit
	  size of buffer to send in run_pictures and fix a fd leak

	* daemon/server.c: fix select call usage

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c: reset the SIGUSR1 to SIG_IGN
	  rather then to default to avoid a crash when the server sends
	  SIGUSR1 on re-init

	* daemon/slave.c: avoid XIOErrors when possible by properly closing
	  the display on normal quick exits.  Also set session_started much
	  later in the session_start as we don't really need it until
	  quite a bit later

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: have flags for did_setcred and opened_session
	  so that we only delete credentials and close session if we have
	  set credentials and opened session respectively

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: split the doubleclick message
	  onto two lines as it's quite long and looks messy as one line.

Thu Jul 24 17:40:09 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmgreeter.c: fix build on systems without PIPE_BUF
	  but with _PC_PIPE_BUF

Thu Jul 24 16:41:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update the version information on top

	* configure.in: bump version number

Thu Jul 24 16:40:07 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: fixed comment so that it
	  shows up for the translators

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: fixed the art.gnome.org link added a link to the
	  GDM website, ran through a spellchecker, whacked the last vestiges
	  of iconification feature mentions and added MinimalUID mention
	  next to Exclude in the overview.

	* README: update a bit

Thu Jul 24 14:58:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/auth.c: change some
	  g_strconcat's to g_build_filename's to address #118040.
	  still more need to be converted

	* gdm.spec.in, daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in, config/Makefile.am,
	  configure.in: By default use logdir of /var/log/gdm just
	  like redhat does it

	* daemon/gdm.c: check logdir to exist and if not set it to
	  ServAuthDir

	* gdm.spec.in, daemon/gdm.c, config/Makefile.am:  Make the
	  ServAuthDir permissions to be 1770 with ownership root.gdm.
	  That makes it impossible for the gdm user to run DoS attacks
	  against the gdm daemon (though without any process limits set
	  it can still somewhat do that)

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.c,
	  daemon/server.c: Hunt more races and hangs.  Make sure we really
	  don't do anything bad in signal handlers by making a setjmp
	  at the beginning of the slave_start function and returning
	  there from signal handlers to do final cleanup kind of stuff.
	  Also when we are receiving TERM signals while waiting on stuff
	  to die, be very un-nice to things and SIGKILL them.  Also stop
	  using sleep if we might be using alarm at the same time.

	* daemon/display.c: whack non-useful signal block push on unmanage,
	  and if we get a TERM signal while waiting on the slave, then send
	  a TERM signal to the slave again.

	* daemon/errorgui.c: set USER, USERNAME and LOGNAME to "gdm" so that
	  they don't end up root by some mistake

	* daemon/slave.c: Use home of root rather then /root for the home
	  directory of gdmsetup.  Also if we can't change to the home
	  directory chdir to / instead of leaving it at servauthdir.
	  Be strict about COOKIEs in the logfile.  Also when things go
	  just a bit wrong and not completely whacko, don't ABORT but
	  just REMANAGE, the toplevel loop of death will handle things
	  for us correctly.  And setsid a very close to the start of
	  the session to avoid a race ABORTing a display by mistake.

	* daemon/slave.c: make the PostLogin behave just like PostSession
	  with respect to the return value

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: avoid races on termination with the
	  verify_cleanup and handle some cases where crashes may (but
	  should not) occur.

	* daemon/gdm.c: whack unneeded signal blockers (the main daemon
	  is all async with a nice mainloop)

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: handle HUP gracefully, when one of the
	  config options we care about changes just restart self
	  instead of 

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c: make
	  the username bold

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update the PostLogin behaviour and the permissions
	  on the ServAuthDir

Wed Jul 23 15:13:33 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.2.98

	* docs/Makefile.am: fix for distcheck

Wed Jul 23 14:29:53 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: whack some debug messages

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: open a pipe
	  for the internal message connection rather then using the fifo.
	  Use the fifo only as backup.  This way we 1) reduce damage gdm
	  user can cause 2) make things faster, no need to open
	  and close the fifo on disk 20 times for each login.

	* daemon/gdm.c: add close notifies for the main connections and
	  NULL the connection pointer when that happens

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/errorgui.c: The close_all_descriptors
	  now takes 2 exception arguments, since we need to keep 2 fd's
	  open for slaves now.

	* daemon/gdm-net.c: fix gdm_connection_open_fd (some copy/paste
	  typos were present)

	* daemon/slave.c: don't run session_stop unless we already ran
	  session_start, and cleanup send_chosen_host to use gdm_slave_send,
	  also wrap the xioerror in gdm_in_signal as it could be

Wed Jul 23 11:41:16 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c: raise the cache time of gethostbyaddr/name to 60 seconds
	  and catch TERM/HUP/INT signals during this time and whack the host
	  resolution when we catch these.  This way it is possible to SIGTERM
	  the gdm daemon during a hanging resolution call.  Fixes issues from
	  #109331

Tue Jul 22 18:15:51 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: use pause() instead of select with all
	  zero arguments.  Also fix select usage in loop in
	  slave_waitpid

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.[ch]:
	  Remove the commented out gnome session chooser stuff

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_timed.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c:  Fix running timed login
	  on empty enter.

Tue Jul 22 15:05:41 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c: set justification according to
	  the anchor.  If the anchor centers the text, center it, etc...

Tue Jul 22 14:31:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c:
	  Set XAUTHORITY to GDM_AUTHFILE always for root processes.
	  Also make sure not to set it if it's NULL already.

	* daemon/auth.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c: use
	  XSetAuthority instead of XAUTHORITY env var as that is
	  more failsafe

	* daemon/errorgui.c: set the DISPLAY and use XSetAuthority
	  instead of relying on XAUTHORITY/DISPLAY being set right
	  (which they not always are).  Also cleanup the dialog
	  startup a bit.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/errorgui.c: chmod the authfile
	  to 640 before a session and back to 644 afterwards.  This
	  reduces the risk from gdm user breakage.  In case someone
	  breaks the gdm user they can't connect to existing
	  user sessions, only new ones.

	* daemon/misc.h, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c: redo the
	  re-init stuff.  Don't close the display before we re-init
	  and then do a nice setjmp hack to notice when the server
	  got re-inited.  This avoids races, avoids an extra process
	  for figuring out the re-init and as icing on the cake it
	  is also about 4-5 seconds faster to re-init not (and the
	  server is re-inited just once instead of thrice which
	  might have been causing some X server whackiness)

	* daemon/server.c: be careful in the log directory as well
	  when opening files and do safer moves there as well
	  for the rotation.

	* daemon/slave.c: whack the stupid extra XOpenDisplay,
	  this is apparently only a workaround for some whacky
	  streams X server connection which we don't support.
	  And this takes up quite a bit of time on startup
	  it turns out.  Also related we'll set the cursor
	  to pointer before we fork so that we don't need to
	  do yet another XOpenDisplay.  This speeds up startup
	  yet some more.

	* daemon/slave.c: when reading the session .desktop file
	  _get it rather then _new it so that we do less reading/parsing
	  on session startup.

	* daemon/slave.c: some cleanup of session ends

Mon Jul 21 15:36:48 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/GdmGreeterThemeManual.txt: removed since this is now in
	  the XML documentation

Mon Jul 21 13:45:31 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm-C.omf: add.  I forgot to add this to CVS :)

Mon Jul 21 12:24:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Xsession.in: eek, it's /dev/null, not dev/null

	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c:
	  Fix #117527, get the root user name from the passwd info
	  rather then assuming it's "root".

	* configure.in: fix #117895, when --with-xinerama=no, don't
	  do the xinerama checks and just don't use xinerama

	* daemon/slave.c:  Fix counting bugs in gdm_in_signal to
	  fix hangs

	* daemon/slave.c: Fix the waiting for notify when
	  inside the usr2 signal handler.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c: Redo the waitpid mess and
	  just use a pipe and select kind of stuff.  Also remove
	  the greeter restarts from within signal handlers as we
	  can just do it now by popping out of the select and doing
	  it there.  This fixes a bunch of races and hangs related
	  to doing too many things from signal handlers.  Also
	  don't do waitpid from the main daemon for slaves children
	  as it won't work anyway and kill the entire process groups.

	* daemon/slave.c: fix the waiting code in focus_first_x_window

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix the clock sensitivity issues by twiddling
	  the sensitive flags on the clock menuitem directly.  Should
	  fix theme ugliness issues with the clock.

	* config/Xsession.in: Apply patch from Steve Chaplin
	  <stevech1097@yahoo.com.au> to fix #117898 to add $0
	  to all the echo messages in this file to make debugging
	  easier.

Sun Jul 20 14:34:42 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: add mnemonics to _Username: and _Password: by a
	  somewhat of a hack.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h:  The
	  iconification feature was broken, instead of fixing it, I just
	  removed it since it was kind of stupid anyway.

	* daemon/misc.c: include xdmcp.h

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: remove the documentation for the Icon key, and
	  add a better blurb in the [servers] description.

Sun Jul 20 12:36:06 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c:
	  Fix some keynav issues from #117776.  Add mnemonics where possible,
	  change some strings to be more HIGgy and such.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c, gui/greeter/gdmthemetester:
	  Scale fonts when screen with is less then 800 by PANGO_SCALE_SMALL
	  and if they are less then 640 by PANGO_SCALE_X_SMALL.  This should
	  make small displays be usable, though this is kind of a hack.
	  There should be some scaling info in the theme rather then this.
	  Also add ability to test different display sizes to theme tester,

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update

Sun Jul 20 11:01:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: mention the GDM manual in the help dialog box.
	  Connecting to the manual is a bit harder since this is usually
	  running as root or on the GDM screen

	* gui/gdmchooser.(c|glade): Fixed most issues from #117784, there is
	  proper keynav, the add button is sensitive only when there is
	  something to add, the messages are shortened a bit to make the
	  interface saner and not have the window change sizes, buttons
	  are reordered, and hostnames in the list are now bold.  Also
	  cap status text at max of 256 chars for sanity of display (maybe
	  should be shortened even more).

	* configure.in: raise version to 2.4.2.98

Sun Jul 20 08:59:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: fix docbook errors

Sat Jul 19 16:40:55 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml: update the way the years in the copyright are done

Sat Jul 19 16:33:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.xml, configure.in, docs/C/Makefile.am,
	  docs/Makefile.am, xmldocs.make, omf.make: update the
	  documentation a lot and install the docs.  Yay!  We
	  have actual documentation now!!!

	* daemon/misc.c: add sys/time.h and sys/resource.h includes
	  (from looking at the FreeBSD patches)

	* daemon/slave.c: pass LOGIN_SETENV as well to setusercontext
	  (from looking at the FreeBSD patches)

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: fix gccism, and look for the chown/chmod command
	  (from looking at the FreeBSD patches)

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: add signal.h include
	  (from looking at the FreeBSD patches)

	* configure.in, utils/Makefile.am:  When the security/pam_misc.h is
	  available also test for where the misc_conv function is as it seems
	  to be sometimes compiled into the main libpam (FreeBSD for example)
	  (from looking at the FreeBSD patches)

	* config/Default.in, config/Xsession.in, config/(Pre|Post)Session.in,
	  config/XKeepsCrashing: don't use command -v and use which properly.
	  And avoid stderr from which

	* utils/gdmaskpass.c: use GETTEXT_PACKAGE here

	* configure.in, utils/gdmtranslate.c, utils/Makefile.am,
	  config/XKeepsCrashing, config/Xsession.in, config/Makefile.am:
	  Add gdmtranslate libexec proggie since gettext command is not
	  always installed apparently (non-developer machines) so we
	  can't rely on it existing.  Also do translations from the
	  Xsession script

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: Fix #117504 by
	  changing the tooltip to be more informative

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: Fix warnings when not all
	  system dialog possibilities are present

	* Makefile.am, greeter.c, greeter.dtd, greeter_configuration.h,
	  greeter_item.[ch], greeter_item_customlist.[ch],
	  greeter_parser.[ch], greeter_system.c:  Add listitem (proposed
	  as customitem to the release-team) tags that can be inside
	  a list and thus create custom widgetry.  At this point all
	  custom widgetry that can be done is a list to pick from but
	  this should be possible to extend for some future releases.
	  This custom info is then written to a per display file
	  to use from login scripts or elsewhere.  While I was there
	  I fixed leaks and crashes when the parser would find parse
	  errors.

	* docs/C/gdmconfig/*, docs/C/gdm.sgml, docs/C/gdm-manual.txt:
	  remove everything here as it was old and unused and outdated.

2003-07-19  Christian Neumair  <chris@gnome-de.org>

	* gui/gdmchooser-strings.c, gui/gdmsetup-strings.c: Use english
	Glade comment, non-ASCII characters may cause weird gettext/intltool
	behavior.

Thu Jul 17 10:43:07 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: require libart 2.3.13 which fixes the crash I was
	  seeing

Wed Jul 16 15:12:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.2.97

Wed Jul 16 15:09:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* NEWS, README, README.install: updates

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/xdmcp.c: Fix current session
	  counting.  Could possibly raise the maximal session count.  Also
	  rename the sessions and pending vars to xdmcp_sessions and
	  xdmcp_pending.  During shutdown don't close xdmcp stuff if it's not
	  enabled.  Close xdmcp if enabled on all possible forks from the
	  main daemon.  Don't quit the main loop from the child handling
	  callback as it's not needed

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: complain to the log file if limits are reached

	* daemon/slave.c: in the slave child handler, make sure the euid
	  is set to 0 so that we can really kill things we want to kill

Tue Jul 15 15:54:14 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/GdmGreeterThemeManual.txt, gui/greeter/Makefile.am,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.dtd, gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml.in,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml.in,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/happygnome.xml.in:  Remove
	  the translations from the .xml.in files (they are now processed
	  by intltool needlessly).  These were not used anyway, we are
	  using stock labels here.  Perhaps people will this way stop putting
	  translated labels inside the themes if they can use stock labels.
	  Also this improves loadup speed a bit as it reduces the average
	  theme xml size from about 25k to about 5k.  Also whack the id
	  timed-rect as it's not used and kill it from the dtd as it's bogus.
	  Update the theme manual adding the userlist and whacking
	  pam-warning which does not exist and other minor fixes and
	  additions.

Tue Jul 15 13:04:26 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: reset limits in cleanup

Tue Jul 15 11:11:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am: add EXTRA_CHOOSER_LIBS to LIBS for gdmchooser

Tue Jul 15 11:08:31 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: check for needing to link in libsocket and libnsl

Tue Jul 15 11:07:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am, gdmchooser.(c|glade): Whack
	  GnomeIconList and replace with GtkTreeView as in the other
	  browsers.  Fixes among other things connecting to the wrong
	  host (Why someone has NOT seen this bug before is a mystery
	  to me, but the chooser was definitely not usable for more
	  then a few hosts and then only if they responded in
	  alphabetical order).  Thanks to Niall Power for spotting this
	  bug.  Also clean up the glade file a bit and don't compile
	  with libgnome/ui anymore.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c:  Add the rules hint for
	  lists since it looks cooler and seems easier to browse to me.

	* NEWS: update

Mon Jul 14 16:44:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/slave.c: Fix #97774 by resetting the
	  rlimits back to infinity after we fork the user session.

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: The default for
	  AlwaysRestartServer is now again false, since it turns out to be
	  a LOT nicer with buggy X servers (and it turns out quite a lot of
	  people have these).

	* daemon/slave.c: properly guess the failsafeness of a session and
	  don't re-guess it again

	* daemon/slave.c: when under the influence of rlimits never
	  ABORT a display since it really could just be that we're hitting
	  stupid limits (definitely set way too low).

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/misc.c: Be extra careful
	  about when to reset signals to avoid races (unlikely though they
	  may be)

Mon Jul 14 12:04:13 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing, config/extract-shell.sh: Fix RH #84247 by
	  checking for gettext first.  We could perhaps require bash here
	  though and use $""

	* daemon/server.[ch], daemon/slave.c: don't twiddle around with the
	  lock files, reading them or whatnot, just whack them and also whack
	  the unix socket, safer and simpler.

Mon Jul 14 11:24:06 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/server.[ch], daemon/slave.c: XFree86 does not wipe it's
	  lockfile sometimes apparently (well obviously it won't if it
	  crashed or some such), so if we find a stale lock file after we
	  kill the server, whack the lock file.  Should address #114003 and
	  redhat #90014

	* daemon/misc.c: be very careful when approaching lockfiles in the
	  /tmp directory

Fri Jul 11 14:31:20 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c:
	  using /tmp as failsafe for HOME seems on second thought patently
	  bad for security.  Use ServAuthDir for gdm processes and / again
	  for user and server.

	* daemon/errorgui.c: Use GtkTextView for the details file display.
	  this be much nicer to CPU/network traffic if the details file is
	  big (GtkLabel is BAD for displaying 500 lines of text quite
	  apparently).  Also fixup encoding conversion issues, and use
	  checkbox instead of a button.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c:
	  update the use of login protocol to sync with gdmlogin

	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/auth.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c:
	  be extra careful even in users home dir and in ServAuthDir when
	  opening files.  Not a huge deal but prevents some possible
	  damage if someone gains the gdm user access somehow.

	* daemon/misc.c: fix minor memleak on conversion errors

	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c, gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:
	  fix compiler warnings.

	* daemon/server.c: support XFree86 version 4 logfile format

	* config/XKeepsCrashing: For XFree86 v4 it's possible that X puts its
	  log not on the command line but into a file, so ask if that
	  should be viewed as well.

	* daemon/gdm.c: whack the stored_path stuff and just restore
	  to the initial env before re execing, also restore env when
	  we launch XKeepsCrashing

	* utils/gdmopen.c: on linux set TERM=linux otherwise the fonts
	  just may not work right

	* NEWS: update

Thu Jul 10 17:12:40 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.c,
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c: use the ve_ versions of the
	  environment funcs and use ve_config instead of gnome_config,
	  and thus killing the libgnome dependency.  The ve-config
	  functions are faster, I trust them more, saner in API and
	  definitely don't leak any memory to children.

	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_capslock.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:  Use the ve_ versions of
	  the environment funcs and ve_config instead of gnome_config,
	  also the use the ve version of the language list function
	  and hand implement the LC_NUMERIC locale push.

	* configure.in, daemon/Makefile.am, gui/Makefile.am,
	  gui/greeter/Makefile.am:  Link against the right ve libs
	  and don't link to libgnome(ui) / glade where not needed

Thu Jul 10 14:33:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in: This is a system SETUP tool, not a system
	  tool so change System keyword to SystemSetup, also add
	  X-Red-Hat-Base, so that it shows up in the non-others menu (This
	  should have been done the other way around IMO, no keyword means
	  it goes in the main menu) </rant>  Fixes bug #116977

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in: sync the defaults for Exclude
	  and add pcap user to excludes

Tue Jul 08 01:42:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade: the DisallowTCP checkbox label is now more
	  clear as to what it does

Tue Jul 08 01:38:34 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/display.c:  If a greeter
	  crashes within 10 seconds of the display being managed, we assume
	  it's unusable, pop up a dialog box and run a different greeter,
	  and next time try the old one over again.  This is mostly in
	  place to catch gdmgreeter crashing (such as currently on my
	  system with a libart bug).  The user can then run the setup and
	  select a different greeter or try to reinstall or upgrade
	  or whatever.  Better then a flickering display.

Tue Jul 08 01:07:08 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c: minor leak fixes in case auth file writes fail

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: properly unref the size group

	* configure.in, NEWS: raise version, add NEWS

Mon Jul 07 18:13:34 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c,
	  gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:  Error dialogs are not warnings,
	  and should have OK and not CLOSE.  Not quite HIG, but closer.

Mon Jul 07 18:04:21 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gui/greeter/Makefile.am: compile gdmgreeter with
	  viciousui (adds also libgnomeui, though we don't use it) (ugh!)

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmcomm.c,
	  gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c,
	  gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/greeter/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/greeter.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: HIGify as many message dialogs
	  as possible.  Buttons now make more sense, ordering is HIGgy,
	  and all such good stuff.

Mon Jul 07 15:42:44 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c, gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: the display check code was
	  wrong, it only used the tcp connections.  Which are the most robust
	  way, but we also really need to check the lock file.

Mon Jul 07 12:41:21 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade), gui/gdmcomm.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Change
	  so that messages in the .po files do not contain unnecessary
	  markup.  Fixes #101794 and #101795

	* config/Makefile.am: make the /etc/X11/dm dir if it doesn't exist
	  fixes #116836

Thu Jul 03 14:57:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c: the details file is read first, capped at 500
	  lines, and so now we can run the errorbox as the gdm user meaning
	  no more gtk code as root.

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/auth.c: Apparently gethostbyaddr can return a dot in the
	  name field meaning unknown host which is kind of bad, so handle
	  that.  In fact make our own saner gdm_gethostby{addr,name} that
	  handle such cases and cache last result for 5 seconds.  This way we
	  do a lot less dns lookups since we used to do 1 or 2 (or even 3)
	  per every xdmcp packet (if tcpwrappers were on).  Also instead of
	  resolving ip to name and back to ip, keep the list of addresses of
	  the host in the display structure.  This all should speed up
	  XDMCP in general and fix XDMCP for places without proper DNS.

	* daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c: /tmp is a much
	  better choice for fallback HOME then / and /bin/sh is a much better
	  fallback then /bin/bash.

2003-07-02  Jordi Mallach  <jordi@sindominio.net>

	* gui/*.desktop.in: Fix Terminal entries and add StartupNotify
	support where appropriate.

2003-06-30  Mohammad DAMT  <mdamt@bisnisweb.com>

	* po/id.po: Added Indonesian translation
	* configure.in: Added "id" to ALL_LINGUAS

2003-06-28  Dafydd Harries  <daf@parnassus.ath.cx>

	* configure.in: Added cy (Welsh) to ALL_LINGUAS.

Thu Jun 26 12:01:55 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, docs/Makefile.am, Makefile.am: actually include the
	  docs dir in the tarball and redo the .96 release (doh!)

Thu Jun 26 11:43:26 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.2.96

Thu Jun 26 08:48:35 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: after setting the label on select, resize login box

Wed Jun 25 18:18:46 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* NEWS, configure.in: prepare for .96

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c: remove unused var

Wed Jun 25 15:38:29 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, config/gdm.conf.in: Fix some typos pointed out by Ali
	  Akcaagac <aliakc@web.de>

	* daemon/errorgui.[ch]: fix a bug with yes/no dialog return and add
	  several button dialog type.  run the dialogs with gdm privileges
	  and not root.  All except the full error with details file.

	* daemon/display.c: turn some info's back into debugs 

	* daemon/getvt.[ch], daemon/gdm.c: push the vt changing stuff into
	  getvt, though it's still a hack

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], config/gdm.conf.in,
	  daemon/verify-*.c: add a double login warning question.  This asks
	  if the user still wants to log in.  If on console and there is
	  another login on a console the user can return to a previous login.
	  Can be turned off by daemon/DoubleLoginWarning=false.  For this
	  we needed notify ack response and a QUERYLOGIN SOP protocol entry.

	* daemon/slave.c: set DESKTOP_SESSION as well as GDMSESSION

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: don't refer to the /etc/pam.d/ dir since
	  that's linux-pam specific

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: add ALL_SERVERS command which returns all the
	  displays on the system similarly to CONSOLE_SERVERS except it
	  does not return any vt information and returns even remote
	  and non-console xnest servers

2003-06-16  Frederic Crozat  <fcrozat@mandrakesoft.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: (greeter_session_init):
	don't use file name from session name.

Thu Jun 12 16:27:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver-xnest.desktop.in, gui/gdmflexiserver.desktop.in,
	  gui/gdmphotosetup.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.desktop.in, 
	  gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in, gui/gdmsetup.glade:  Fix #85543 by
	  changing the .desktops to call gdm Login Screen and not GDM.  Also
	  update corresponding window titles.

Thu Jun 12  Diego Gonzalez <diego@pemas.net>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_session.c (greeter_session_init): initialize sessnames 
	  hash table to avoid crash upon start.

Thu Jun 12 15:51:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-shadow.c, daemon/verify-crypt.c: fix compilation and
	  face browser for non-pam setups

Thu Jun 12 12:28:49 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c: Allow empty label text

Wed Jun 11 16:04:02 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in: Sync defaults into
	  with the header file.  Add comment about the gtk modules stuff
	  and make it default to what you'd normally have for accessibility
	  (though it doesn't add them by default).  The gdm.h defaults to
	  no modules though.  Also if we can't find an X server, default
	  to the Linux setup so that the beast at least builds.

	* docs/Makefile.am: actually include the theme document, DUH!

Wed Jun 11  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* configure.in, config/gdm.conf.in: Fixed setting of DefaultPath and
	RootPath so it works properly.  Properly export X_SERVER_PATH in
	configure.in.

Wed Jun 11 09:13:50 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: add ifdefs around the change_to_first_and_clear since
	  that's a linux only function.  Fixes compilation on non-linux.

Wed Jun 11  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* config/CDE.desktop.in, config/Makefile.am: Add support for
	logging into CDE sessions.

Tue Jun 10 16:54:04 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.2.95

	* config/Makefile.am: dist fixes

Tue Jun 10 16:47:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Fix the session setup, and get rid of the quoting
	  unquoting badness.  Also fix a race in the focus_first_x_window
	  function

	* daemon/gdm.c: ensure that the GdmXsession is set to something

Tue Jun 10 16:04:40 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c:  It is silly to have a secret argument.  The
	  script can already get the session .desktop from the GDMSESSION
	  environmental variable, so there's no reason to pass it.

Tue Jun 10 15:57:39 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, config/Xsession.in: Change the argument to the
	  Xsession to be the Exec= line of the .desktop and not the .desktop,
	  that was kind of silly in retrospect.  We still pass the desktop,
	  but it's kind of secret since I don't want people to depend on this
	  second argument.  Also update the comments inside the Xsession
	  to reflect what's really going on.

Tue Jun 10 09:59:44 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: remove removed files from the generated files list

Tue Jun 10 09:23:16 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Default.desktop.in, config/Xsession.in, config/Makefile.am:
	  Apparently I can't read.  The original discussion actually
	  mentioned what I thought "Xclients" are and named it "default".
	  Also there is the "custom" type, but there is no .desktop for that

	* daemon/slave.c: actually compile

Mon Jun 09 17:12:04 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: if Exec=failsafe exec the internal xterm failsafe
	  session.

Mon Jun 09 17:01:27 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c: use $HOME/.face by default

	* daemon/slave.c: when no home dir, try /tmp as the home and not /

	* config/*, daemon/gdm.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.[ch]:  Rework the session setup as
	  discussed with Oswald Buddenhagen, the kdm maintainer.   Now the
	  sessions are .desktop files and we have one happy Xsession file
	  which parses that .desktop file and runs the appropriate command.
	  Also store preferences such as last session and language in .dmrc.
	  The session desktops are now in /etc/X11/dm/Sessions since they can
	  be shared by kdm as well in the future.  The setup needs a bit
	  more tuning I think and it's not all tested.  Also remove the
	  GNOME chooser session stuff while I was at it.

Mon Jun 09  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c: Fixed bug that caused the
	keymouselistener to get into a broken state that would cause
	applications to freeze.

Sun Jun 08 23:49:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h, daemon/verify-pam.c: Add patch
	  from Brian Cameron to fix #106537 (at lest the default/login
	  thing).  That is read some solaris preference file when logging
	  in.

Fri Jun 06 19:07:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/GdmGreeterThemeManual.txt:  Update a bit on theme creation and
	  the .desktop file and add notes about gdmthemetester

Fri Jun 06 16:41:47 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: I should check if things compile, shouldn't I

Fri Jun 06 16:39:17 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c, gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmchooser.c,
	  gui/gdmcomm.c, gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmphotosetup.c, gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c,
	  gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c, gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:
	  Dialogs have no separators.  Makes them look at least a bit closer
	  to HIG

Fri Jun 06 13:05:14 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/filecheck.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/auth.c: add another
	  argument to the file check to silence warnings about some missing
	  dirs where it is ok for them to be missing (in "run_pictures")

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.c: On Linux detect the runlevel, and if
	  the runlevel is 0 or 6 after session stops (and we weren't started
	  in 0 or 6) then wait 30 seconds after the session stops.  This
	  should fix login coming up again when the user selected reboot
	  or halt from the logout menu.  Also when we do reboot or shutdown
	  ourselves on linux, change to vt1, clear the screen and print a nice
	  message about it, otherwise the shutdown/reboot looks kind of
	  bad I think.

Fri Jun 06 11:21:44 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_capslock.[ch]: add a query for the capslock
	  state in the greeter

	* daemon/verify-*.c: fix #71496 by checking the capslock state
	  before telling the user that he should make sure it's off.  Also
	  only say "invalid username or password" if we actually did ask for
	  a password, else the message would be silly indeed (note that
	  the check if we did ask for password is a silly hack, but the
	  verify-pam.c code is a large set of silly hacks and as such it's
	  ok to add yet another one)

Fri Jun 06 09:43:39 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade): attempt at hig-ifying the xdmcp page

Thu Jun 05 13:26:09 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade), gui/greeter/greeter_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_pareser.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c
	  gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h:  Use the Welcome label in
	  the greeter (as long as the stock welcome string was used),
	  Add RemoteWelcome for XDMCP sessions.  Change default of Welcome
	  to just plain "Welcome".  Move the welcome string setup to the
	  main property page in the setup since it now affects both greeters.

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade): the first page of the properties needed
	  some size group love

Thu Jun 05 11:37:19 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/auth.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/errorgui.c,
	  daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c: Fix #56654 by removing
	  programmer references out of translatable strings

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:  An attempt at getting at least
	  a little bit closer to the HIG specification.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c, gui/gdmsetup.glade,
	  config/gdm.conf.in, gui/greeter/themes/*/*.xml.in:
	  The system menu is renamed to "Actions" since that's a lot more
	  appropriate

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: Applied patch from Mihael Vrbanec
	  <Mihael.Vrbanec@stud.uni-karlsruhe.de> to activate the action if
	  you double click on the radio button.

Wed Jun 04 17:34:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: Fix some issues from bug #106537.  don't
	  ever set RUSER and only set RHOST if not a console login.  Fix
	  leaks in the conversation functions on error.

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: Translate a bunch of common pam messages (I
	  got some from strings pam_unix.so)

	* daemon/verify-*.c: change "Password: " to "Password:", that space
	  didn't make sense

Wed Jun 04 16:30:38 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-*.c, daemon/verify.h:
	  The pam setup now asks for the username itself.  This is
	  accompanied by a set of hacks to make this actually work and
	  make it work with the browsers.  Add a select user interrupt,	
	  since user selection is now done differently.  Also support
	  the username changing during the pam_authenticate as it apparently
	  can.  Also fix the authenticate sleep delay to not be done if
	  we have interrupted.

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/misc.[ch],
	  daemon/verify-*.c: Kill the LocalNoPasswordUsers since it won't
	  work with the new pam setup

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.[ch]:
	  Update to the new protocol for the new pam setup.  Also replace the
	  standard greeter browser with a tree view based browser just like
	  in the graphical greeter.

Wed Jun 04  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* docs/GdmGreeterThemeManual.txt: Added theme docs.

Wed Jun 04 10:53:21 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.(c|glade), gui/gdmwm.c: after 3 seconds of no
	  response print an error message if a host was just added.  If the
	  host sent back an unwilling, print an error message as well saying
	  that.  Also fix centering and the initial size of the chooser.

Tue Jun 03 13:56:24 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: change ScanTime default to 4,
	  which really coincides with the fact that we scan 3 times in
	  2 second intervals.  Maybe I should just whack this config thing,
	  it is eminently stupid for this to be configurable.

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: when we press refresh whack the select_addr,
	  so that it doesn't get selected on refresh since by now that
	  may be irrelevant.  Also if an addr is already in the query
	  list, don't readd it.

Tue Jun 03 13:37:31 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in, configure.in, utils/Makefile.am, daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/misc.c, daemon/gdm.c, config/XkeepsCrashing:
	  whack gdmmktemp since it wasn't being used, move gdmaskpass and
	  gdmopen to libexec since that's where they really belong

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in, gui/gdmchooser.(c|glade): add an
	  "Add" entry and button so that, we can add random hosts by typing
	  their name.  Add chooser/AllowAdd config key (default to true)
	  that controls if this is available.  Also fix up the updating of
	  the icon list.  it was incredibly evil and rebuilt the list each
	  time a host packet came in, this compounded with the fact that
	  we were pinging 3 times (at least the broadcast to which everyone
	  answers).  Also make this run fairly sanely outside of GDM,
	  so that you can really just run it from anywhere if you really
	  wish (mostly for debugging, though I imagine some other uses might
	  pop up).

Tue Jun 03 11:11:20 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c:
	  whack subtype, though read it from "legacy" xml files into "type"
	  (as long as type was "system"), also add a "config" stock label
	  if someone really wanted to do a config button.  If the type
	  is now config, halt, reboot, suspend or chooser, automatically
	  check if SystemMenu is enabled, which avoids the whole subtype
	  nonsense.
 
	* gui/greeter/greeter.dtd:  Update for the above and also add the
	  stock labels for config and chooser

Tue Jun 03 10:41:03 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.dtd: update the DTD for the chooser stuff.
	  Also the type/subtype stuff was wrong (it is all kinds of wrong
	  really, this should be changed).

Fri May 30 12:02:59 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: just do exit rather then gdm_main_quit, since that
	  might possible have issues and we can really just exit cleanly.

	* daemon/slave.c: if we can't start the chooser, we could still maybe
	  start the greeter if this was just a temporary thing, so just
	  remanage

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/display.c: Rework the loop of death thing.
	  it was really really broken.  It wasn't catching 5 sessions in 90
	  seconds, but 5 consecutive sessions 90secs or less, which is wrong.
	  So this is fixed and raised to 6 sessions in 90 secs, none of them
	  over 30 secs.  Also the sleep time is now 8 seconds ONLY after 2
	  tries which makes the chooser normally pop up faster.  Also the
	  DISPLAY_RUN_CHOOSER thing resets the loop of death since we are
	  expecting a short session.  Also if the loop of death is caught,
	  no longer abort the display but wait 2 minutes before starting
	  again.  This way a malicious local user at an internet cafe can't
	  whack gdm into disabling the local display.

Fri May 30 09:40:31 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/server.c: when there is a query in the command line,
	  don't add the -nolisten tcp even if DisallowTCP is on, also don't
	  add this when not resolving flags (it would make no sense to
	  query something over tcp and disallow listening tcp at the
	  same time)

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add note about DisallowTCP not working when
	  the server is in query mode

Fri May 30 08:50:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c:
	  The F10 menu for the entry is now better, removed the System entry
	  and just whack the system menu in there, that's a lot nicer,
	  also add a tooltip to the entry that tells about the F10 menu.

Fri May 30  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* configure.in, config/Default.in, config/PreSession.in,
	config/PostSession.in: Now Default, PreSession and PostSession
	are built using .in files so that we can properly set the
	PATH on Solaris.

Thu May 29 17:38:56 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: update the default config for the new
	  chooser server flag by adding another example server setup
	  and add ChooserButton key.  Also use @X_SERVER@ for the terminal
	  server setup

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.[ch],
	  daemon/slave.c:  Add a server "chooser=true" flag which will
	  make the daemon run a chooser instead of a greeter.  Also
	  if the greeter returns with a DISPLAY_RUN_CHOOSER, then run
	  the chooser for one session.  Also add notification stuff
	  for the ChooserButton option.  Note that this doesn't need
	  XDMCP to be running locally.

	* daemon/slave.c: if the chooser is closed exit with
	  DISPLAY_REMANAGE

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade): add the ChooserButton key

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h, gui/greeter/greeter_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:
	  Add the "Run XDMCP chooser" button to the system menus here,
	  and allow a chooser button in the greeter.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: Fix the second SUSPEND exit status
	  usage to the suspend interrupt.  Add toolips to the system menu
	  radiobuttons (these should not be radiobuttons! but I'm too lazy to
	  change that now), also add mnemonics here

Wed May 28  Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* config/Makefile.am: Install PostLogin file to the postlogindir
	directory rather than the postdir.  This was causing make install
	to fail.

Tue May 27 08:52:20 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: add the utf8 translation for belarussian.

Mon May 19 14:42:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c, gui/greeter/greeter_session.c, 
	  gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: make OK the default action
	  to make pressing Enter work as expected

	* gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: if there are too many sessions
	  to fit on screen add a scrollbox to fix #104120

Mon May 19 13:56:52 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade: Fix #104757 by adding a scrolled window to the
	  theme preview thingie.  This way if the theme description is too
	  big the window doesn't change size.

Mon May 19 13:03:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: do the face browser warning only if gdmlogin
	  is selected for both greeters

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add nfsnobody to Exclude

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: when direct is on and we're looking
	  at the local server don't check indirect key for being on

	* gui/greeter/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item.h, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_ulist.[ch]:
	  Based on a patch from Patrizio Bruno <desertconsulting@firenze.net>,
	  add face browser support by adding a list item, this list item
	  should have id of "userlist" and it will be populated with
	  the users just like the gdmlogin browser.  When a user name is
	  selected (either by typing it in or selecting in the list) it
	  will be always selected in the list as well (which should make
	  some people happy).  I think we should use this kind of browser
	  in gtklogin as well, because it is much cooler.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.dtd: update DTD for the list item

	* configure.in, gui/greeter/themes/happygnome-list/*,
	  gui/greeter/themes/Makefile.am: Add a happygnome theme
	  with a face browser using the new list item

Fri May 16 20:46:43 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c, config/locale.alias: added Malaylam, Marathi
	  and Oriya languages

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: fix #105923 by
	  changing the "Configure..." item to "Configure the login
	  manager..."

	* utils/gdmopen.c: fix the -l option to actually work right

	* daemon/slave.c: fix Redhat #91031 by prepending the dash
	  to the command rather then replacing the command with a dash
	  when running the shell.  This was contributed by
	  mlblandf@sedona.intel.com (Michael Blandford)

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: change PingInterval to
	  PingIntervalSeconds

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: update DisallowTCP properly

	* daemon/slave.c: set GDMSESSION before running PreSession

	* daemon/misc.c: fixed warnings and an uninitialized var use

2003-05-15 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* configure.in: Updated to add AccessDwellMouseEvents.in reference.
	* gui/modules/Makefile.in: Updated to add dwell listener references.
	* gui/modules/AccessDwellMouseEvents.in
	gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c: Added a gestures listener for
	dwell events (cursor motion only).
	* gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in gui/modules/keymouselistener.c:
	Minor cleanup.

Thu May 15 02:17:55 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c,
	  daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: add a suspend interruption
	  and a SOP command.  The greeter interrupts, the slave notices
	  and proxies with a SOP command to the master which suspends.
	  perhaps a bit too complex ...  Fixes #108700

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], config/gdm.conf.in,
	  config/PostLogin, config/Makefile.am:  Add a PostLogin script
	  which is run right after login before any user setup is done
	  and allows things like home mounting and stuff.  Should
	  address issues from bug #103258

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c:  Fix #106207 by
	  proper use of 'than' rather than 'then'

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c, gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade),
	  config/gdm.conf.in: Add a security/DisallowTCP setting which
	  will append -nolisten tcp to X server command line always,
	  and make this the default.  Fixes #87291

Tue May 13 17:00:16 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in,
	  docs/C/gdm.(xml|sgml):  PingInterval is now in seconds.  It really
	  makes no sense in minutes, I mean who wants to use a connection
	  which hangs for several minutes, that makes no sense.  This
	  fixes a whole bunch of bugs, among others #103266

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade, gui/gdmsetup.c: add some accessibility stuff,
	  change the ping interval label to say seconds and not minutes,
	  and add "Delete theme" button which fixes #110302

Tue May 13 12:22:45 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: when more then 50 users don't put them all in the
	  combo boxes, this is a semi-solution to #111830

	* daemon/verify-shadow.c: Apply patch from cschelcher@free.fr to fall
	  back to standard password when shadow is not available.  Apparently
	  fixes NIS stuff, but I really think people should be using pam,
	  but I digress.  Fixes #109765

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c:
	  use strerror instead of g_strerror as that returns always UTF-8
	  and we want current locale.  We already assume strerror is on
	  the system so this is not a portability issue anyway.  Fixes
	  #106655

	* utils/gdmopen.c: apply patch from Owen Taylor to fix #106656
	  by not deallocating the vt after we are done as apparently this
	  is what open does and the kernel has a fit otherwise anyway.
	  It's braindead, but oh well, this is the way it apparently works
	  right.

	* daemon/gdm.c: apply patch from Owen Taylor to fix #106657
	  by setting TEXTDOMAIN to GETTEXT_PACKAGE rather then PACKAGE
	  before running scripts

	* utils/gdmopen.c, daemon/misc.c: Apply patch from Owen Taylor
	  to fix #106658, but fix it portably by adding the -l
	  option to gdmopen as suggested by Owen.  So all gdmopens
	  we do are now using login shells which makes me wonder if we
	  should just build that into gdmopen, since it's a special
	  purpose utility anyhow.

2003-05-08 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.dtd: Updated so it is no longer
	out of date.  Patch provided by Aidan.Butler@Sun.COM.

2003-05-08  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Fix traditional Chinese language name.

2003-05-06  Guntupalli Karunakar  <karunakar@freedomink.org>

	* configure.in: Added "hi" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2003-05-06  Danilo Šegan  <dsegan@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Added "sr" and "sr@Latn" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Mon May 05 13:33:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: fixup files list and lang stuff

	* config/Makefile.am: fixup link creation (don't use absolute name)

2003-05-02 Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>

	* gui/modules/keymouselistener.c, gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in
	Now the keymouselistener does not use grabs, so there is less
	opportunity for conflict with other programs (like the registryd).
	Now duration and timeout is specified in ms rather than seconds,
	which allows more flexibility.  Duration values of 0 to indicate
	a keypress of any length is now supported.

2003-04-30 Niall Power <Niall.Power@Sun.COM>

	* configure.in config/gdm.conf.in gui/Makefile.am gui/gdmlogin.c
	  po/POTFILES.in
	 Added Files: gui/modules/AccessKeyMouseEvents.in, 
	 gui/modules/Makefile.am, gui/modules/keymouselistener.c
 	 Added a keyboard/mouse button gesture listener. This is a gtk
	 module that is configurable by editing AccessKeyMouseEvents
	 in ($sysconfdir)/gdm/modules

2003-04-30  Laurent Dhima <laurenti@alblinux.net>

	* configure.in: Added 'sq' to ALL_LINGUAS.

2003-04-10 Niall Power <Niall.Power@Sun.COM>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/gdm.h daemon/slave.c,
	  docs/C/gdm.xml: Add support for launching gdmlogin/gdmgreeter
	  with a configurable list of gtk modules. Needed for accessibility.
	  Adds two new options to gdm.conf: "AddGtkModules" (boolean) and
	  "GtkModulesList" (string).

2003-04-09 Niall Power <Niall.Power@Sun.COM>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: Detect Xsun xinerama and Xdmcp on 
	  Solaris. Patch by Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM>
	* config/gdm.conf.in: set Xserver paths correctly for both 
	  XFree86 and Xsun. Patch by Brian Cameron (Brian.Cameron@Sun.COM)
	* daemon/slave.c, gui/Makefile.am gui/gdmwm.c: added Xinerama 
	  support for Solaris/Xsun platforms.

2003-03-15  Ross Golder <ross@golder.org>

	* config/locale.alias, gui/gdmlanguages.c: Sorted into proper
	  alphabetic order. (fixes #106293)

2003-03-13  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "ml" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Wed Mar 05 15:11:49 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, daemon/Makefile.am, gui/Makefile.am,
	  gui/greeter/Makefile.am, utils/Makefile.am,
	  vicious-extensions/Makefile.am, daemon/slave.c, daemon/choose.c:
	  Fix Solaris build, a patch from Niall Power <Niall.Power@Sun.COM>

2003-03-03  Ross Golder <rossg@golder.org>

	* gui/gdmlanguage.c, config/locale.alias: Added language support
	  for these languages - Mongolian, Indonesian, Kannada, Hindi
	  Bengali, Belarusian, Bosnian, Welsh, Persian, Interlingua,
	  Albanian, Serbian, Yiddish and Panjabi.

Fri Feb 28 12:32:37 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: hmmm xdmcp/PingInterval was not present
	  here so add

Fri Feb 28 12:29:51 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: raise DisplaysPerHost to default
	  to 2.

2003-02-26  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* configure.in: Added Walloon (wa) to ALL_LINGUAS

2003-02-26  Taneem Ahmed  <taneem@eyetap.org>

	* configure.in: Added "bn" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2003-02-21  Roozbeh Pournader  <roozbeh@sharif.edu>

	* configure.in: Added "fa" back after fixing the bug.

2003-02-18  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Disabled "fa" as it's broken and breaks the
	build.

2003-02-18  Roozbeh Pournader  <roozbeh@sharif.edu>

	* configure.in: Added "fa" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2003-02-17  Sanlig Badral  <badral@chinggis.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguage.c, config/locale.alias: Added Mongolian

2003-02-16  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c: Fix typo in comment.
	* daemon/verify-pam.c: Same.
	* daemon/verify-shadow: Here too.
	
2003-02-13  Ross Golder <rossg@golder.org>

	* configure.in, gui/gdmlanguage.c, locale.alias: Added Thai
	  language support.

Mon Feb 03 09:18:01 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.1.3

Mon Feb 03 09:16:10 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/md5.[ch]: Fix redhat bug #83334 by applying a modified
	  patch from Matt Wilson.  Basically use guint32 instead of
	  our own type.  This fixes cookie generation (and likely crashes)
	  on non-alpha 64bit platforms.  Has 0 effect on non-64 bit
	  platforms.  Also: My hovercraft is full of eels.

Fri Jan 31 16:03:51 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: do something similar as in the other
	  modules since I have some minor issues with po directory handling.
	  The biggest change is building po first before others, dunno if
	  that makes any difference

Sat Jan 25 09:13:32 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.1.2

2003-01-22  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "mn" to ALL_LINGUAS.

Wed Jan 22 09:32:46 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: did I leave debug info around? silly me.

Wed Jan 22 09:31:28 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: Fixing a critical bug in a very non-critical part
	  of gdm, so bugger all whatever the current freeze policy is (don't
	  have time to figure that out).  Anyway, this should make the
	  selection work with keyboard and not connect you to the wrong host
	  if you do that.

2003-01-20  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* configure.in: Added Macedonain (mk) to ALL_LINGUAS

Fri Jan 17 10:55:58 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am: don't whack the intltool*.in files on distclean

Mon Jan 13 17:06:24 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.1.1

Mon Jan 13 09:57:57 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c: workaround broken librsvg
	  handling of numeric locale by pushing c numeric locale before
	  entering rsvg code.  Patch also being sent to librsvg.

Mon Jan 13 01:00:23 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm: add pam_env

	* gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: make the language
	  dialog at least 400 pixels wide, should fix #103254

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: don't translate stuff that comes from
	  pam, that should already be translated and this fixes #102691

Sun Jan 12 10:46:25 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: make always restart server default
	  to true, since it's just safer and who cares it flickers.  This
	  should "fix" a bunch of issues in bugzillas.  I'm now leaning
	  towards just whacking the server HUP code as that will streamline
	  the code ...

Thu Jan 09 16:59:21 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: query the user in case
	  reboot/halt/suspend comes directly from a theme button

Wed Jan 08 10:32:18 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/locale.alias: change utf8 to UTF-8 as that's what X
	  expects.  A patch from Mike Fabian <mfabian@suse.de>

Mon Jan 06 09:37:21 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: very minor code cleanup

Thu Jan 02 11:15:22 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.1.0

Thu Jan 02 10:53:35 2003  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c: add <stock type="foo"> type
	  tags for stock labels.  This will be useful when we are changing
	  those labels 

	* gui/greeter/themes/*/*.xml.in: add the new stock type tags and
	  keep old text tags for compatibility.  This way the theme can
	  still be loaded by an older gdmgreeter.

	* configure.in: prepare for 2.4.1.0

Sat Dec 21 14:30:01 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: Fixing #94554, by drawing the BackgroundColor
	  on the background always.  This doesn't make any difference
	  on local displays, but should look less bad on Xinerama displays.

Sat Dec 21 14:05:40 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade, gui/gdmsetup-strings.c: Apply patch from
	  bugzilla #101729 to untranslate the Copyright string

Sat Dec 21 13:54:18 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: fix the shell basename check.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c: Fix bug #75939
	  by allowing passing a Tab to the entry.  We're not really using
	  the Tab to tab around anyway.

Sat Dec 21 12:09:44 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmcomm.c: update the message when GDM is not running

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: when not using GDM, then check for this
	  and tell the user and not let him in as it would then make no
	  sense.  Fixes RH #70326 and GNOME #101653

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item.c: Fix greeter_item_expand_text to
	  be utf8 safe.  Fixes GNOME #100738

	* gui/greeter/greeter_session.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: Fix symlinks as
	  session files.  Fixes GNOME #95380

Fri Dec 20 14:53:26 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/locale.alias, gui/gdmlanguages.c: add Amharic language to
	  the list

2002-12-17  Alex Duggan <aldug@gnome.org>
	
	* gui/gdmflexiserver.desktop.in: fix typo, s/loging/logging/

2002-11-18  Fernando Herrera <fherrera@onirica.com>

	* gui/*/*.desktop.in: add X-GNOME-BUGZILLA stuff

2002-11-13  Dmitry G. Mastrukov  <dmitry@taurussoft.org>

	* configure.in: Added Belarusian to ALL_LINGUAS.

Mon Nov 11 Luis Villa <louie@ximian.com>
	
	* config/gnomerc.in: comment out gnome-volume-control since it no
	  longer has a -i mode and interferes with startup.
	
Wed Sep 11 12:35:37 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.[ch]:  Store initial
	  environment and use it for the errorgui, use internal routines for
	  converting to/from utf8 and make sure they always return NULL and
	  they never use the internal glib iconv cache crack.  This should
	  fix running gdm in non-utf8 non-english locales with respect to the
	  internal error gui stuff.

Wed Sep 04 11:29:03 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c: Apply patch from Havoc from bug
	  #91921 to fix word wrap for japanese and such

	* daemon/misc.[ch]: add a utility to unset signals, also unset
	  signals and do setsid in the extra process.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c:
	  Use the above function to unset signals in children.  Also unlink
	  .xsession-errors before openning it just to be strict (and to work
	  even if the user used some older gdms that made the file have
	  root permissions and such nonsense).  Also when killing the extra
	  process kill the whole process group in case the extra process
 	  makes children.

Fri Aug 30 12:22:19 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.11

Fri Aug 30 12:20:40 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c: Fix test on fork to avoid
	  duplicate slave processes.  This makes things actually work
	  on subsequent logins.  Also note a timeout of a message in
	  the syslog if we can.

Fri Aug 30 10:11:15 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: we no longer need libglade-convert so don't check for
	  it

Tue Aug 27 18:41:17 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.10

Tue Aug 27 18:40:11 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm-safe-restart.in, gdm-restart.in, gdm-stop.in: use the
	  expanded version of the sysconf prefix to fix installation
	  into weird prefixes

Tue Aug 27 18:35:16 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/server.c: tiny bit of cleanup

Tue Aug 27 18:14:20 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: when we get the term signal do cleanup but no
	  longer wait for message ackgnoledgement from the daemon since the
	  daemon may no longer be entering mainloop and may not even be
	  processing messages.

Sat Aug 24 18:40:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.9

Fri Aug 23 16:45:16 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/server.c: redo the SIGCHLD handler to be done in a saner
	  manner.

Fri Aug 23 15:27:55 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/server.c: do a cool hack to figure out when the server
	  restarts.  Fork a process, open the display, HUP the server and
	  have the process wait for an xioerror and die.

	* daemon/display.c: add some debugging

Fri Aug 23 14:12:10 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c:  Cleanup the exit stuff

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c: don't do setsid on -nodaemon
	  as that breaks running from init and do it for the slave as
	  that's correct.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c:  Cleanup
	  killing children a bit, and session cleanup stuff.  Don't
	  kill pids not greater then 1 to be extra strict and if we can't
	  fork the slave set the pid to 0 and not leave it at -1.

	* daemon/server.c: kill redundant line

Fri Aug 23 11:04:38 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c: Whack DefaultLocale as that
	  setting was on crack to begin with.  If the system default
	  is being used just don't set anything.  If you want gdm
	  to use some language other then the system default, change
	  the gdm startup script, but that doesn't seem to make much
	  sense.  Check for language existence and if it doesn't exist
	  use the system default.  Now bsd and non-bsd language setup
	  is not different (And is still bsd-setusercontext-nice).
	  Whack the unaliasing of languages.  That was complete nonsense,

	* daemon/auth.c: when UserAuthDir is ~ make it the home dir,
	  when it starts with ~/, prepend the home dir.  This actually
	  makes this setting usable

	* config/gdm.conf.in: lot more documentation comments.  I really
	  REALLY should write docs for gdm at some point.

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: also accept <host>.png as host images.  That's
	  really a lot more sane and nicer.

Fri Aug 23 01:56:21 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, NEWS: prepare for 2.4.0.9

Fri Aug 23 01:09:36 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix subtle possible race that could kill another
	  process and simplify code in the meantime.  Ignore SIGCHLD, and
	  don't wait for the background process until we want to kill it,
	  that may leave a zombie for a little bit if the process dies early,
	  but who cares.

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/slave.c: Fix many many very minor races but such that
	  could conceivably take things down (a kill (0,...) "could"
	  very theoretically occur previously).  Fix some worse but still
	  not very likely races by using the push/pop of sigchld block in
	  places where we blocked by hand.  Ensure all processes are always
	  killed on slave exit (probably doing things redundantly in some
	  cases).  Fix some possible cases of syslog from a signal which
	  does bad things to our karma sometimes.  When the server dies
	  make sure we don't do anything with the display (we null the d->dsp
	  var) to make sure we don't reenter the xioerror_handler.  The
	  extra_process uses 0 and not -1 as the no value everywhere.
	  Make sure kills are never called with -1 (probably just strict,
	  but one never knows).  Do setsid and the init in daemonize
	  on -nodaemon as well.  Do setsid for greeter/chooser/config.
	  May fix redhat bug #72295

Thu Aug 22 16:04:56 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c, config/locale.alias: The locale in the
	  locale.alias file can be a comma separated list now and we
	  now test locales to make sure they exist.  This way we can
	  use the utf8 locales if they exist rather then plain locales.
	  And we also don't list locales that the C library doesn't support
	  in the first place.  This should make things very nice if you're
	  installing gdm over the latest redhat betas (as in, you will
	  get utf8 locales as in the redhat version)

Thu Aug 22 12:23:49 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.[ch], daemon/Makefile.am,
	  daemon/getvt.[ch], daemon/xdmcp.c, config/gdm.conf.in:
	  Make the vt member exist for non-linux systems as well just
	  for kicks.  Set up a vt allocation thingie (kind of a hack
	  to get a VT higher then a certain number, but oh well).  Currently
	  only for linux.  And add vt<number> arguments unless there
	  was such an argument added already.  This should fix all
	  the problems with people running gdm as a service since
	  all the VT stuff is so horribly broken.  Should fix #62997.
	  Adds two keys FirstVT and VTAllocation to control this
	  behaviour.

Tue Aug 20 10:28:45 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.8

Mon Aug 19 16:50:30 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: whack the redundant queries for
	  halt, reboot and suspend, we already have a dialog the person
	  answers.  Fixes #90971

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_capslock.c: include libgnome.h

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: Listen for a property on the root window
	  _GDM_SETUP_INSENSITIVE and if non-zero make self insensitive

	* daemon/slave.c: when restarting the greeter set the above property
	  to make the setup be insensitive for a bit.  This makes sure the
	  user doesn't twiddle with the interface which could make things
	  weird looking, especially if the user twiddles greeter settings or
	  opens new windows.

Mon Aug 19 12:17:22 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* pixmaps/gdm.png: my gf didn't like my other icon so of course ... I
	  had to make a different one.

Mon Aug 19 11:53:56 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: bind signals INT/TERM/HUP and send a SIGTERM
	  to the xnest when we get them.

Thu Aug 15 12:04:24 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c: remove some dead code.  Ensure euid's
	  in more places.  open .xsession-errors even on nfs dirs properly.
	  For the Init/PreSession/PostSession scripts always setup the
	  GDM_PARENT_* stuff for Xnest displays.  Don't use temp files, but
	  name the temporary auth file by the display name and whack it
	  on server stop.  The Init/PreSession/PostSession scripts now
	  execute /<displayname>, if not found then /<hostname>, if not
	  found and XDMCP then /XDMCP, if not found and flexi then /Flexi,
	  and only if none of those are found then /Default.

	* daemon/errorgui.c: show label and entry in the question dialog,
	  fixes problems when asking for questions during autologin.  Also
	  set cursor to pointer.

	* daemon/slave.c: set cursor to pointer after forking slave.  This
	  should fix possible busy cursor stuck after an autologin.

	* config/PostSession: spelling fix

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: add extra message for automatic login
	  for standalone conversation thingie.  This uses already translated
	  string.

	* daemon/gdm.c: wait 2 seconds between killing local servers,
	  otherwise things go very very bad on some machines (such as eating
	  my keyboard on mine)

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, gdm-stop.in: new script to just SIGTERM
	  the gdm binary.  Useful for debugging

2002-08-15  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* gui/greeter/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): include gdmthemetester

Wed Aug 14 19:59:26 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Default, config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/display.c,
	  daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_capslock.c:
	  Set GDM_PARENT_DISPLAY and GDM_PARENT_XAUTHORITY for greeter and
	  the Init script.  In the Init script try to migrate the keyboard
	  configuration to the new server.  Also kill the -kb option from the
	  Xnest command line.  This should fix all the fun problems with
	  keyboard and Xnest.  More likely Xnest should get fixed.

Wed Aug 14 16:01:41 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/Makfile.am, gui/greeter/gdmthemetester: a script to
	  run gdmgreeter in Xnest to test themes in the various environments

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_capslock.c: if GDM_PARENT_DISPLAY is set
	  then use it to get capslock state.  Currently only used in
	  gdmthemetester as we have to figure out how to do this inside
	  the daemon with the cookies and all that.

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: close the 0,1,2 descriptors so that we may
	  do things such as `gdmXnest -b`

Wed Aug 14 12:16:30 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: whack old debug printf (it wasn't harmful due to
	  the way we do things, but still it was evil)

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c:
	  Do the focus stuff correctly instead of trapping tab and all that,
	  unset CAN_FOCUS on widgets other then the entry.  Make sure that
	  an entry exists in the graphical greeter.  Add a fake menubar
	  below the entry in the graphical greeter so that we always can get
	  to all the commands even on a whacked out theme.  Plus it may be
	  nicer to use then the mnemonics if you just use F10.  Now the whole
	  thing should be more accessibility friendly as well.  When
	  'doing_development' make the entry sensitive.  Must make a
	  theme tester.

Tue Aug 13 17:05:55 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.[ch], daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/misc.[ch],
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/display.c:
	  Sure fire way to open /dev/null and give error when system
	  on crack.  Also clean up processes properly on gdm_fail
	  and don't use the buffered stderr.

	* config/Makefile.am: if the user is using the default config
	  (gdm.conf is the same as the factory-gdm.conf) then just overwrite
	  gdm.conf with the new one in the installation.

Tue Aug 13 16:15:08 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in: The Shutdown/Halt/Suspend keys can now be
	  a list of commands.  If this is the case, the first working one
	  will be used.  This way we can find the most appropriate command
	  to use and distros will not have to redo the config as much.

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/verify-*.c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in: Add a long standing feature request of no
	  password logins for certain users on the local console.  Just
	  set LocalNoPasswordUsers to a list of such users.  Fixes #51908

	* daemon/server.c: on re-init of server do a sleep(1) after the
	  kill (pid, SIGHUP) as an incredible hack to avoid a race.  Fun
	  fun fun with the X server.

Tue Aug 13 12:49:18 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: update this, add MinimalUID, add a bunch of
	  comments and reorganize a little bit to be more logical

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: when the gdm.xpm isn't found for icon try gdm.png
	  to make it easier for transition to the new nicer icon

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Don't use gtk_dialog_run, that makes the
	  main window here modal and we don't want that.  Fixes #90613.  

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am: don't install gdm.xpm anymore

Tue Aug 13 11:52:28 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* pixmaps/Makefile.am, pixmaps/gdm.png, pixmaps/gdm-foot-logo.png:
	  Create new icon myself.  New large logo thing with the new foot

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h, gui/*.desktop.in: use the new
	  logo and icon everywhere

Tue Aug 13 08:27:18 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: update comment on top to be correct
	  (USR1 vs. HUP) redhat bug 71308

Thu Aug 08 09:36:11 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.7

Thu Aug 08 09:33:50 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gettextfoo.h, config/XKeepsCrashing:  Fix the message bits.

Wed Aug 07 21:01:41 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in, gui/gdmlogin.c: Add a new key
	  RunBackgroundProgramAlways.  It is now normally false, and if
	  it is false, background program is run ONLY if the BackgroundType
	  is set to 0 (None), setting it to true will revert to previous
	  behaviour.  This is to work around the crackladden xsri hack that
	  redhat does and still have nice gui way to config backgrounds.

Wed Aug 07 20:23:28 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml.in,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml.in:
	  Use _Language instead of Option for the language_button

Wed Aug 07 20:20:17 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/*.c: include file fixups

	* gui/greeter/greeter_events.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter.[ch],
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.c:
	  Add an incredible hack for doing mnemonics on the graphical
	  greeter with offscreen buttons and such stuff.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: fix window close should do cancel
	  not ok.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c: ignore also
	  left_tab (shift+tab), and the KP versions of up/down/tab,
	  so that we don't lose focus

	* gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml.in,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/happygnome.xml.in: use the
	  mnemonic versions of the button labels so that we get some
	  keynav.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c: when we can't get any translations,
	  try our own gettext database to find the text.

Wed Aug 07 18:38:11 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: some fixups to the default
	  values, chooser should no longer get arguments,
	  s/gdmconfig/gdmsetup/

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c: run the failsafe xterm thing on the
	  lower right hand corner as that's much nicer.

2002-08-07  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing (XCONFIGURATOR): add redhat-config-xfree86
	to list of config tools to look for

Wed Aug 07 16:23:13 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.6

Wed Aug 07 16:19:13 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_pam_item.c: ignore up/down/tab just like
	  in the standard greeter

Wed Aug 07 15:50:24 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: fix crasher bug on closing of the window (redhat
	  bug 70861) and related bugs.  This also fixes making changes
	  persistent even if the window was closed very quickly after the
	  changes were made (within the change timeout)

Wed Aug 07 14:10:57 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Makefile.am: overwrite gnomerc and create .orig as with the
	  other scripts

	* daemon/slave.c: don't set GDM_LANG unless the user actually
	  selected something.  This should make things nicer on system
	  langauge sensing things.

	* config/Gnome.in, config/Xsession.in: normalize langauge stuff in
	  case the user selected a language.  whack LC_ALL, LANGUAGE and
	  LINGUAS if they differ from GDM_LANG if this was set (if not
	  using 'System default' language setting).  Should fix #89970

Wed Aug 07 12:01:06 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: add a SOFT_RESTART_SERVERS
	  fifo command to force a restart of X servers that no one is logged
	  in on right away, unlike the DIRTY_SERVERS which just marks servers
	  as dirty and to be restarted

Wed Aug 07 11:22:16 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c: Add a DIRTY_SERVERS
	  command and related slave notification to have the slave remanage
	  instead of regenerating the X server.  This is good for upgrading
	  X configuration and all that.  This can be done by a simple:
	  (echo;echo DIRTY_SERVERS) > /var/gdm/.gdmfifo
	  This is a possible solution for issues as described in redhat
	  bug 70072

	* daemon/verify-(pam|crypt|shadow).c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c:  Clear the initial notice
	  from the daemon rather then on the greeter with the ugly
	  first_return hack.  Should fix redhat bug 70991

	* daemon/server.c, gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: redo the font path stuff.
	  Now we just get the current font path from the parent and pass -fp
	  argument to Xnest with that path.  This should work more generally
	  and besides the last night fix was not 100% correct anyway.  Also
	  make this work for gdmXnestchooser.

Wed Aug 07 01:23:55 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/server.c: when starting up a server as a different uid, add
	  the font paths that the gnome-settings-daemon sets for that user.
	  This fixes #89308.

Tue Aug 06 13:35:15 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: prepare for 2.4.0.6

	* gui/gdmlanguages.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: fix some RTL issues with
	  the language list

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: read and honor the gtkrc setting, fixes
	  #90003

	* gui/Makefile.am: make the gdmXnest link relative and not absolute

Mon Aug 05 11:17:20 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: don't use stdout/stdin for communication with the
	  greeter.  This is first a cleanup and second it may just actually
	  fix the freebsd issue.  I know I've been promising that in every
	  release, but without a freebsd box I can't actually test this :)

Mon Aug 05 10:12:57 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in, config/Xsession.in: whack xdm resource reading,
	  that's only for xdm, doh!  Hmm ... where did I copy this from?

Tue Jul 30 16:58:50 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.5

Tue Jul 30 16:56:51 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: fix setting the welcome string properly

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix resizing of window.  Resize when the content
	  doesn't fit.  Update logo and background on the fly, this reduces
	  the weirdness when trying to change this stuff from the setup
	  proggie and the wm keeps disappearing since we're restarting the
	  greeter.  Need to solve the restart thing nicer.  Also when
	  we can't load the background image, set the color at least.

Tue Jul 30 14:36:28 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: added a few more untranslated strings

Tue Jul 30 14:13:53 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: add a failsafe en_US language in case there is
	  no en_* language in the locale alias file.  This replaces adding
	  failsafe 'C' locale, fixes #89452

Tue Jul 30 13:25:42 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: s/.gnome/.gnome2/, Applied patch
	  from #89454.  But still also read .gnome/photo if we can't find
	  .gnome2/photo

Tue Jul 30 12:00:28 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: fix the linux-only process detection thing to work
	  on non-linux systems correctly (logic was reversed).  Properly cast
	  when printing to the pid file (being strict).  Close the pid file
	  before failing.  Don't print out the SYSLOG 'handling message'
	  debug thing as it just clutters debug info.

Mon Jul 29 17:45:59 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: use the ve_signal routines, remove gdm_signal
	  routines

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_clock.[ch]: use the ve_signal routines
	  for the HUP signal to avoid possible crashes/races/hangs if the
	  signal handler comes in a bad time.  Also don't reset the graphical
	  on every change, just the ones we care about, and update clock on the
	  fly instead of restarting.

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: make glade_helper not use the gnome_program
	  thingie, since we never init it here.

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmchooser.c,
	  gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmcomm.c
	  gui/greeter/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_clock.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_capslock.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c:
	  Compile without deprecated stuff. fix minor bugs found during
	  the process.  Also compile everything with warnings and fix those.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmcomm.c, gui/gdmsetup.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c:  Use the new ve-config routines rather then
	  gnome_config.  Fixed config bugs found in the process.  This
	  also makes gdmsetup not delete comments and empty lines from the
	  config which makes debugging and hand editing SO MUCH SIMPLER!

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: recheck for gdm running before every update

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: remove the g_io_channel_init
	  call which was resetting the whole setup.  So our channels were
	  still buffered and encoded, which manifested itself when the
	  read calls were replaced the read_chars.  This could actually solve
	  the FreeBSD issues too.

2002-07-27  Yanko Kaneti <yaneti@declera.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Added the untranslated Bulgarian string.

Wed Jul 24 12:53:40 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.4

2002-07-24  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* config/gnomerc.in: make this valid shell

Tue Jul 23 15:15:16 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: change dir to /root or / when starting the
	  setup proggie.  Also set the busy cursor in the main process
	  rather then risk weird things happening from two processes
	  trying to do it at the same time.

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: support .bz2 archives for theme installing

Tue Jul 23 12:20:26 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.3

Tue Jul 23 11:20:56 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gnomerc.in, config/Makefile.am, config/Xsesssion.in,
	  config/Gnome.in:  prefer the gnome-session in PATH, fix some
	  startup stuff add gnome-volume-control init to gnomerc,
	  whack the redhat specific setup, and copy parts of the redhat's
	  Xsession file to our own and if switchdesk is installed make
	  Xsession the default, so now all the good stuff happens on
	  redhat even if you leave the default session.  And this Xsession
	  file should work on other systems just as well.

	* config/gdm.conf.in, config/PreSession, daemon/gdm.h:  My gf doesn't
	  like those ugly green backgrounds so change the color to what
	  ximian uses as I kind of like that, (and did I mention that
	  this way it's not green?).  Also set the background in PreSession
	  so that you get it for all sessions as default.

	* daemon/gdm.c: fix error handling of bad reboot/suspend/halt,
	  add chdir ("/") from the hpux ximain patches, in the signal_notify
	  add a main loop wakeup function which may fix some issues possibly
	  the freebsd issues and should make this work on hpux just like the
	  complicated and mostly weird ximian patch.

Tue Jul 23 07:47:11 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in, config/Xsession: read the xdm Xresources file as
	  well since that's where it is in rh nowdays as it seems.

Mon Jul 22 16:45:43 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: add a hack to fix #64662.  When
	  the shell is something that we don't really know (we know
	  a few shells) just start the session with bash or sh (whichever
	  we find).  

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/gdm.[ch],
	  config/PreSession, config/PostSession: Write out an fake Xservers
	  file each time before the PreSession script so that we may use the
	  sessreg command nicely.  Also look for sessreg in the path and
	  a few extra dirs.  And use the utmp file as well.

	* config/Default: setup the system Xmodmap here, copied from kdm
	  a bit.  This should fix #86098, at least it does for me.

	* config/PreSession, daemon/slave.c: Run the PreSession script from
	  the session pid and in the PreSession script exec sessreg.  This
	  fixes the utmp bugs as sessreg will now register the correct pid
	  in utmp.  Also move the .xsession-errors before the PreSession
	  script and let through the stdout/stderr descriptors so that
	  we can get errors such as sessreg failing.  Also don't error out
	  when PreSession fails if this is a failsafe session.

	* daemon/slave.c: the pid of the session is not cleared until the
	  session is over.  It's not a race as I previously thought and in
	  fact it could leave processes behind maybe.

	* daemon/errorgui.c: make the errors display wider, recenter the
	  window and do a bit of cleanup

2002-07-22  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am (install-data-local): make the link to /foo not
	$DESTDIR/foo

Sun Jul 21 13:04:08 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am: add -f to the LN_S line

Sun Jul 21 12:57:57 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/auth.c, daemon/misc.c,
	  gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item.c: note that gethostname doesn't
	  neccessairly nul terminate string

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: fix background xnest mode,
	  add plain X nest mode by just running gdmXnest.  Use gtk dialogs
	  instead of gnomes.  Setup a cookie in plain x nest mode.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/display.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:
	  use the waitpid version from ve that doesn't break on signals
	  this could fix some possible session being killed bugs
	  unintentionally

Sat Jul 20 10:19:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmsetup.c: setup busy cursor when starting
	  config

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c: add GDM_SAVEDIE request so that restarts
	  of the greeter from the daemon also work and use this for the
	  restart from the slave on greeter change.  #88533

	* gui/gdmwm.c: do process_events before a restore_wm_order
	  so that we restore wm order after all our things have been
	  finished so that the wm order is really restored especially on
	  the graphical greeter

2002-07-18  Frederic Crozat  <fcrozat@mandrakesoft.com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/Makefile.am:
	add disconnect.png to Makefile.am. Fix happygnome theme when
	using tarball

Wed Jul 17 11:17:10 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/locale.alias, gui/gdmlanguages.c: add Swedish (Finland)
	  to the language list, fixes #88423

Tue Jul 16 15:38:46 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade): move the 24 hour clock to the first page
	  since it affects both greeters now.  Also play around with
	  the themebrowser.  GtkLabel refuses to wrap text for some reason
	  so for now put in GtkTextView's.  This makes it look somewhat
	  more ugly (or pretty depending on your taste), but it actually
	  wraps the description as it needs to.

Tue Jul 16 11:37:22 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/locale.alias, gui/gdmlanguages.c:  Added a few more languages
	  And fixed the naming for english and brazilian portuguese which
	  fixes #88273

Tue Jul 16 10:49:44 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.2

Tue Jul 16 10:14:08 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/display.c, daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/gdm.c
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c:  Make process invocation about
	  600us faster by making a helper function for closing all
	  descriptors that is somewhat smarter then the inline code was,
	  and on this occasion alsofix the failsafe question dialog to
	  actually work.

	* daemon/server.c: fix debug output on stopping server

Mon Jul 15 16:44:24 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/locale.alias: remove the "English" entry, the other two
	  english ones will suffice.  Also do a bit of renaming, although
	  this does not break any user visible strings.  We really need some
	  nice way of getting currently installed locales instead of this
	  file.  And we need to have the locale translation table understand
	  many many more locales.  Oh well.

Mon Jul 15 15:47:11 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/slave.c:  Clean up the comm stuff to only use unbuffered
	  libc functions.  This might fix the freebsd issues perhaps,
	  maybe.  Also fix some almost impossible to happen races.

Mon Jul 15 14:55:27 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* NEWS, configure.in: prepare for 2.4.0.2

Sat Jul 13 17:03:15 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.in: use "." instead of "source" as I didn't realize
	  that "source" is not on the freebsd /bin/sh

Fri Jul 12 14:17:54 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.in: source in /etc/profile if it exists.  This way we
	  really do get system wide environment for gdm.

Fri Jul 12 10:06:23 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* **/*.desktop.in:  Add "Encoding=UTF-8"

Fri Jul 12 09:38:24 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: ensure descriptors 0,1 and 2 exist.  This may fix
	  an issue running gdm out of /etc/ttys on freebsd.

Thu Jul 11 17:50:15 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmwm.c: unfortunately when we do a reparent on an already
	  mapped window we will get an unmap and a map, so we ignore the
	  next unmap/map.  Also fix a crash in moving override redirect
	  windows (windows gdmwm doesn't know)

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: move the g_atexit to the place where we run the
	  background prog

Thu Jul 11 15:15:42 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: corrected yodaspeak and thus #83077

Thu Jul 11 13:33:41 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c, config/locale.alias:  Added Macedonian
	  fixes #84290, added Malay to the language alias list,
	  added some more untranslated names, added Vietnamese

Thu Jul 11 13:31:01 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c:  Fix saving of languages,
	  Add Last and System default language choices.  When setting system
	  default just return "" as that's what the daemon expects

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: add the System default language choice, and
	  for system default just return "" as above

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: Ask before
	  saving a new language if nothing was saved before and we were
	  using the system default

	* daemon/slave.c: when we get the system default language wipe the
	  user lang setting

Thu Jul 11 10:54:28 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item.c:  Apply a patch from
	  Terje Rosten <terjeros@phys.ntnu.no> to also obey the 24 hour
	  clock setting in the graphical greeter.  This makes the setup
	  proggie a little inconsistent as the setting is in the standard
	  greeter tab, so we'll have to figure that one out as well.

Thu Jul 11 10:39:18 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm-net.c, daemon/xdmcp.c: some indenting foo

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c:  Set
	  the IO channels to be unbuffered just like in the daemon and
	  set their encoding to NULL.  We want to be as raw as possible

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c: initially leave
	  the prompt entry insensitive.  Also initially set the entry to
	  "..." in the greeter since otherwise it will be a little
	  unresponsive to the first keystroke.  Fixes #83187

Thu Jul 11 09:41:55 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm-net.c, daemon/xdmcp.c: Apply patch from
	  Kesor <kesor@mail.ru> to set the io channel encoding to NULL
	  before trying to make it unbuffered to get rid of warning 

2002-07-11 Hasbullah Bin Pit <sebol@ikhlas.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c : Added Malay / B.Melayu as language options.

Thu Jul 11 2002  Steve Fox <drfickle@uberh4x0r.org>

	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/*: Update Happy GNOME theme
	with new logo, new Disconnect/Quit icon 

Wed Jul 10 13:36:03 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/gdmchooser.c:  When we first open the X connection, set
	  the cursor to a busy cursor (watch) and also don't set the
	  pointer cursor in the greeters until we are actually ready.
	  Also do cursor voodoo in the chooser.

Tue Jul 09 15:29:00 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: some more sanity from Oswald, but this doesn't
	  fix a real bug, just a theoretical one.

Tue Jul 09 15:26:43 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.1

Tue Jul 09 11:09:53 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, daemon/Makefile.am: Fix #85785 by adding all the
	  extra libs (which includes -lcrypt) to the LDFLAGS of the
	  gdm_binary.  This also as a side effect doesn't link all those
	  libs to things that don't need them.

Tue Jul 09 10:47:31 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: before running gdm_fail in the config parsing
	  set pid file to NULL so that we don't wipe it.  Also
	  implement a linux specific hack to check for stale pids,
	  this is largely due to (Jim Bray <jb@cs.wcu.edu>).  It should
	  just work as before on non-Linux systems.

Tue Jul 09 10:27:51 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c:  Fix some errors with server
	  starting, fix alarm/sleep collisions, add a handled flag to
	  servers so that we can setup unhandled X servers (such as
	  for X terminals)

Tue Jul 09 09:14:55 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: do the display init before the user setup for
	  automatic logins

Tue Jul 09 09:08:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c: handle fails on user auth writing by going to the
	  fallback file to handle things in a saner way.  Fixed
	  locking/unlocking to be done properly and fixed leaks in the purge
	  function.

Tue Jul 09 08:44:04 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Fix a bug with finding the parent process
	  (Oswald Buddenhagen <ossi@kde.org>)

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: the autologin should do setcred/open_session
	  just like normal login

Mon Jul 08 20:42:27 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, NEWS: raise version add some news

Mon Jul 08 20:01:23 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h, daemon/misc.c, gui/gdmchooser.c:
	  if available include <sys/sockio.h>.  Should fix first
	  part of #86679

	* gui/Makefile.am: link gdmsetup and gdmflexiserver with -lXau,
	  should fix second part of #86679

	* gui/gdmwm.c: Fix #86620, don't set up the wm stuff if the
	  substructureredirect selection fails on the root window.

	* daemon/slave.c: don't clear the env for chooser, greeter and
	  config.  I suppose it was fairly foolish to do so anyway.
	  Should fix #87387 partly

	* configure.in, daemon/gdm.in, daemon/Makefile.am: rename
	  gdm to gdm-binary and install a new script called gdm
	  which calls gdm-binary.  This way the standard env is
	  read in and other good stuff can happen.  Should fix #87387
	  completely

	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: properly center windows

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: don't die on every minor problem, and
	  fix querying the interfaces

	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmsetup.c: fix crashes and the event
	  fixup function

	* gui/gdmchooser.glade: fix signal connections so that we can
	  actually select some host

2002-07-08  Frederic Crozat  <fcrozat@mandrakesoft.com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/Makefile.am:
	add missing files (fixes #86264)

Sun Jul 07 06:26:51 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: some sanity checking before doing a kill

Sat Jul 06 19:28:09 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Don't send greeter pids that are 0, fixes #84717 and
	  some others.  Whoops!

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: Fix #85681 by putting the gdm_xdmcpfd outside of
	  the #ifdef so non-xdmcp compiles should work again

	* configure.in: Hopefully fix #85785 by adding -lcrypt before other
	  libs.  Also apply patch from dalgoda@ix.netcom.com (Mike Castle)
	  to fix #86607 by adding proper includes for X before testing 
	  for xdmcp libs

2002-06-24  Yanko Kaneti <yaneti@declera.com>

	* configure.in: (ALL_LINGUAS) Added Bulgarian (bg).

Fri Jun 07 21:21:33 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.4.0.0

2002-06-07  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST):
	s/circles/happygnome/

Thu Jun 06 15:32:01 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* NEWS, configure.in: preparation for 2.4.0.0

Thu Jun 06 11:47:26 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, po/POTFILES.in, gui/greeter/themes/Makefile.am,
	  gui/greeter/themes/happygnome/*:  Add the happygnome theme,
	  so finally the theme browser makes sense since you can now
	  switch between two themes :)  If we're in freeze we can at least
	  add themes ...

Tue Jun 04 21:45:19 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.3.90.6

	* configure.in: raise version

	* daemon/gdm.c: properly update the first login bool so
	  that not all logins after a slave dies are first logins.

	* daemon/slave.c: SECURITY FIX! after the automatic login,
	  return from the gdm_slave_run so that the display can be
	  re-inited.  Else clients may be left around.  Fixes #84055

Mon Jun 03 11:43:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.3.90.5

Sun Jun 02 12:51:20 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/locale.alias: rewrite.  Use the languages that we know for
	  starters, don't put any duplicates.  Don't put any encodings.
	  put a note on the top of file about how broken this is.  However
	  this should be less broken then it was so far.

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: fix collating languages, when the current
	  locale is not among the languages, add it (it will be put into
	  others section as just the language code).  This way users can
	  always select the current system locale.

2002-06-02  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* config/locale.alias: Make Norwegian use ISO-8859-15.
	
Sat Jun 01 20:43:33 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: We had hebrew in reverse order, so when pango
	  reversed it again, it came out reversed

Sat Jun 01 20:31:54 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: surround each langauge
	  with <span lang="??_??">foo</span> markup so that display is done
	  hopefully correctly.

Sat Jun 01 17:21:38 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_capslock_item.c: include config.h

	* gui/greeter/greeter_timed_item.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h, gui/greeter/greeter.c:
	  Implement timed logins so that we're on par with the standard
	  login on this.  Implement the timed show type stuff and add
	  %s and %d (named such so that we don't have to add strings)
	  and change the original %d to %o for domain.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: implement disable/enable stuff

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item.h, gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.h:
	  cleanup

	* gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml.in: some geometry fixes,
	  add a timed item.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.[ch]:
	  add the support for leftover messages on QUIT.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_timed.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: up the timer
	  on both keypress and button press events on ALL widgets.

	* daemon/misc.h: fix gdm_test_opt prototype

Sun Jun 02 01:35:00 2002  Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@gnome-db.org>

	* config/locale.alias: The es_ES locale is now ISO-8859-15 to add euro
	support.

Sat Jun 01 14:42:29 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am: build the gdmlanguages.c as a library

	* gui/gdmlanguages.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add untranslated names
	  so that we can do what we do in the graphical greeter, and
	  we have only one place where languages are handled.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h, gui/greeter/Makefile.am:
	  use the libgdmlang.a lib and scrap the custom language list.
	  now languages are the same as they are in the standard greeter.
	  Unfortunately there were yet still some strings that weren't
	  marked for translation.

Sat Jun 01 09:12:59 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h: Default the -kb argument to Xnest
	  This is because Xnest doesn't seem to want to read the x config
	  file and so you'd have to manually set xkb kind of stuff and this
	  way you'll sort of inherit the layout from the toplevel X server,
	  except you won't have access to xkb, and hopefully that's not a
	  problem.  Fixes #66610

Fri May 31 15:55:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.[ch]: a new function (yet unused) to find out valid
	  arguments of a command

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: properly get the command, fixes things
	  so that it now really does launch the command from the
	  config file or the one from command line.

Fri May 31 10:12:04 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_lang_list.c: add more untranslated language
	  names.  Hmmm.  The whole language list setup in the greeter is
	  b0rk, this should be merged with the way languages are done in 
	  gdmlogin

2002-05-31  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@debian.org>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_lang_list.c: Added Korean
	untranslated_name to the languages list.

Thu May 30 13:30:01 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_lang_list.c, greeter/greeter_action_language.c,
	  greeter/greeter_item_pam.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Use the new conversion
	  routines from ve, use the new strftime from ve.  Also add the
	  correct includes so that the graphical greeter is now actually
	  translated.  This among other things fixes #82548

	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c: correctly get the language, fixes
	  #82549

	* gui/gdmchooser.glade: remove unused dialog

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/errorgui.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:
	  We can no longer use g_print as we did before as it now does
	  charset conversions and that can screw us up in a major way.
	  so replace most uses with printf/fflush

Wed May 29 14:13:45 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.3.90.4

Mon May 27 13:39:52 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/slave.c: remove some dead code, minor fixes

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: remove gnome init, remove dead code

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: remove hang on browser image getting

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: remove the trusted dir crack.  Now we always
	  copy to ~/.gnome/photo. this removes the need for needing to
	  know gnome's pixmap path, and gets rid of some uglyness.  We
	  still support a bit of the trusted dir stuff in the daemon for
	  compatibility.

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: don't create dirs only when running under gdm

2002-05-27  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: Fix typo.
	
Fri May 24 13:48:45 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c: use the "xml:lang" attribute not
	  "lang"

Fri May 24 13:40:35 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/themes/circles/Makefile.am,
	  gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml.in,
	  gui/greeter/themes/circles/GdmGreeterTheme.desktop.in,
	  po/POTFILES.in: Start using intltool for the theme stuff.  And
	  while doing this rename the GdmGreeterTheme.info to
	  GdmGreeterTheme.desktop since that's more convenient for intltool.
	  But still accept themes with GdmGreeterTheme.info for laughs.
	  This should make the greeter at least translatable

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h:  Add configuration option
	  to the system dialog thingie (it's ugly!) and don't add items which
	  we know won't work (such as suspend if GdmSuspend isn't there)

	* gui/greeter/Makefile.am: link with libvicious at least

Tue May 21 19:13:49 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: Remove the bad hack with sending
	  the temporary files.  Just read the file and and send it over via a
	  pipe.

Tue May 21 16:47:53 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version to .4

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am, gui/greeter/Makefile.am: hopefully
	  fix #79374 by add -lX11 to the link lines

	* gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c: fix OK/CANCEL order, #80038

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], gui/gdmflexiserver.c: change the format of the
	  FLEXI_XNEST request.  Now we require version 2.3.90.4 and
	  there is also a uid parameter.  We then seteuid to this uid
	  before checking authenticity, this makes things work when the
	  home dir is on nfs.  Fixes #82122

Tue May 21 15:44:00 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c: make the interface querying work again

	* daemon/server.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/misc.c: don't completely
	  fail when gethostname fails, just assume "localhost.localdomain"
	  in that case.  Should fix some of the hostname bugs and make
	  things work on more broken setups.

Tue May 22 23:55:00 2002  Carlos Perello Marin <carlos@gnome-db.org>

	* configure.in: Added AC_PREREQ(2.52) to force the 2.52 use if you
	have autoconf 2.13 && 2.52.

Tue May 21 15:12:51 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, accconfig.h: check for setresuid

	* daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/misc.[ch]: use setresuid to really
	  get rid of setuidiness

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix accelerators.  Since now we have nice
	  visible accelerators (mnemonics) we no longer need the Esc one
	  which wasn't working anyway

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c:  Don't init
	  gnome.  This only breaks the getting of the gnome pixmap dir, so
	  whack the places where this is done.  It's not a big deal really.
	  And not initing things really helps a lot in both init speed,
	  random crashes, hangs, and security.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/errorgui.[ch], config/Xsession:  Now
	  we open the .xsession-errors file early on, in fact for all
	  non-failsafe sessions.  If the session is less then 10 seconds
	  long warn the user of possible errors and let him view the
	  .xsession-errors file.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/auth.c: give error output when we can't
	  setup the authentication file.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/errorgui.c: fix focus issues, fix crash
	  for the error gui boxes

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: fix typo

Mon May 20 17:55:57 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: don't allow autologin on anything but
	  local servers since it doesn't make sense anywhere else.
	  (timed login yes, just not the autologin).  Should fix #68160

Fri May 17 17:05:44 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, gui/gdchooser.glade: update some strings to be
	  more consistent

Fri May 17 16:10:15 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c, daemon/slave.c, configure.in, acconfig.h: Use BSD's
	  setusercontext if found.  If language is unset and there is no
	  saved preference then if we're using setusercontext don't reset
	  LANG so that the users login.conf preference takes over

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmsetup.c: Add a new key
	  greeter/MinimalUID which sets the minimal uid which is needed
	  to show up in the browser or the dropdown list in gdmsetup

	* daemon/gdmlogin.c: whack the "*" checking in the password field,
	  since we may get it normally

Wed May 15 22:55:58 2002  Christophe Merlet  <christophe@merlet.net>

	* Makefile.am, config/Makefile.am: Added $DESTDIR variable.

Tue May 14 17:13:33 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: fixed crash, I'm such an idiot, oh well
	  fortunately the crash would happen only after things finished so
	  most users would only notice a new corefile being created on exit :)

Tue May 14 15:40:34 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am: remove all the gdmconfig stuff and add
	  gdmchooser.gladep and gdmsetup.gladep

Tue May 14 14:54:20 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.3.90.3

Tue May 14 14:53:51 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* NEWS, configure.in: increment version, prepare for release

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: fix initial selection of the current greeter

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/gdm.[ch],
	  daemon/misc.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c:  Fix deadlocks
	  when using the syslog inside a signal handler by sending the
	  message to the main daemon which then syslogs it.

Tue May 14 12:08:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c, daemon/auth.c:  Apply some leak fixes from
	  ali.akcaagac@stud.fh-wilhelmshaven.de (Ali Akcaagac) #80888.  That
	  is only those that really made sense

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Port to GtkDialog, should fix #80835

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c: fix #80829
	  and add a whole bunch of checks for server paths so that we
	  find servers other then /usr/bin/X11/X, also look for proggies
	  in /opt/X11R6/bin

	* configure.in: check for socklen_t and define it to be size_t
	  if not found, fixes #79373

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/xdmcp.c,
	  daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/server.c: Fix slave notifications.  We
	  can't use a mainloop here since slaves are all synchroneous.  So
	  we use a variety of signals and hacks to get this to work.

Tue May 14 02:26:01 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.c: a bit of debug info for the slave
	  notifications which are utterly broken.  Will need a signal or some
	  such.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c:  do all
	  the right utf8/locale conversions just like gdmlogin

Tue May 14 01:25:03 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/misc.[ch],
	  daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-pam.c,
	  gui/gdmlogin.c:  Switch to using the locale specific codeset on
	  the daemon to simplify things.  Do all utf8 stuff/translations on
	  the greeter since else the glib gconv cache will get screwed up
	  and we'll have a mess on our hands.  This finally makes
	  translations other then ascii using locales work.

	* daemon/slave.c: fix restarting when waiting on the greeter

Mon May 13 22:29:47 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: fix focus on failsafe xterm session

Mon May 13 18:09:30 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/gdmwm.[ch]:  Add focus/no focus on the
	  login window when running config, as well as restoring the disabled
	  state after a restart.  Fix restarting of greeter.   Fix a hang
	  after login.  Fix killing of server on all REMANAGE exits.  Also
	  create a saving of the window stacking order so that when we
	  restart with a setup window active the stacking order doesn't
	  get screwed up.

	* daemon/misc.c, daemon/verify-pam.c: convert to correct codeset.
	  This is still not all working and it's quite bad.  Must fix
	  this.  Maybe run the daemon under normal locale codeset.  That
	  will simplify things.

	* daemon/server.c: doing a syslog in alarm signal handler was hanging

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: remove some cruft

	* gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmwm.[ch]: remove the CONFIG_WINDOW crack

2002-05-13  Rosanna Yuen  <zana@webwynk.net>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: include libintl.h and locale.h

Sat May 11 23:38:02 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.[ch],
	  daemon/verify-(pam|crypt|shadow).c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c:  Change the interruption stuff, to remove
	  some races and the restart of greeters is done by return code

	* gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/gdmwm.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter.c:  Add a property on the setup windows so
	  that we can raise the setup windows after a restart of the greeter,
	  this doesn't really work yet well.

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: add some more error checking and change the
	  ownership/permissions correctly on installed themes

Fri May 10 15:52:07 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade: a bit of work on the accessibility stuff
	  (labefor/labelledby, not really all done yet).  Add some mnemonics,
	  etc...

Fri May 10 15:21:40 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c:  Finish connecting everything to the config file.
	  Don't do updates when nothing has changed.  Add a simple temporary
	  help dialog.  Warn (and ask what to do) if a theme you are trying
	  to install already exists in the theme dir.  Remove the fake
	  testing theme entries.

	* config/gdm.conf.in:  Add a comment to the top of the file

Tue May 07 23:01:10 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: enable the setup of the pixmap entries.  Note that
	  this requires a fix to libgnomeui which I just committed.  If you
	  get a segv on startup update libgnomeui

Wed May  8 01:20:57 2002  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@gnome.org>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c (setup_xdmcp_support): clean up the UI a tad.

Tue May 07 17:22:37 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.c: display an error if install of theme failed

Tue May 07 17:16:31 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade): work on install new theme functionality

	* gui/greeter/theme/circles/GdmGreeterTheme.info: update

Tue May 07 14:39:18 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade): more theme browser work, selection now
	  works.  Though it's not yet propagated to the config.

Mon May 06 23:34:54 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: a note to distributors about the welcome
	  string, and add new greeter config thingies

	* gui/greeter/greeter-configuration.h, gui/greeter/greeter.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter-canvas-item.c, daemon/gdm.h: use the global
	  gdm header file for defining config keys

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: start using the GdmGreeterTheme.info file
	  for figuring out the theme and the GraphicalTheme key now just
	  specifies the subdir in which to find under the GraphicalThemeDir
	  directory.  Also fix the gettext stuff a bit.

	* gui/greeter/themes/cirlces/screenshot.png, 
	  gui/greeter/themes/cirlces/GdmGreeterTheme.info:
	  gui/greeter/themes/cirlces/Makefile.am: add circles screenshot

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: use the circles in entry config key.  Also reado
	  how translation is done for the welcome string

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade): start implementing a cool theme browser and
	  start connecting more widgets.  Make the welcome string editing
	  work by just whacking ALL translations and using the current string
	  when it is edited.

Mon May 06 10:40:47 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Also make this init only gtk since initing gnome
	  came up with weird errors and was a security risk anyway.

Mon May 06 10:39:41 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/verify-pam.c, po/cs.po, config/gdm.conf.in,
	  daemon/gdm.c: Try to solve some of the pending translation issues
	  mainly with utf8 kinds of weirdness.  Not yet completely solved
	  though.

Fri May 03 16:42:42 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: add notifies for sysmenu and
	  config available

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade, gui/gdmsetup.c:  glade design pages for both
	  greeters and connect a few of the items to actual config.  Also
	  add security sysmenu and config_available items

2002-05-03  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS):
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): turn off help for now, until it's
	ported to xml etc.

2002-05-01  Pablo Saratxaga  <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* configure.in: Added Vietnamese (vi) to ALL_LINGUAS

2002-04-29  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add gdmconfig - mailed _v_ asking to
	fix this completely

2002-04-28  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* gui/gdmchooser-strings.c: Typo.
	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Rephrased description of Basic setting to
	  reduce ambiguity.
	* gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade(|2): Added
	  Chinese locales.

2002-04-29  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* gui/Makefile.am:
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.desktop.in:
	* gui/login-photo.png:

	Add a rudimentary icon for the photo chooser "capplet"
	so it doesn't look weird as the only item without
	an icon ;-)
	
Fri Apr 26 14:29:07 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c: a bit of a hack, but create an
	  interruption type for greeter restart.  It's easier to do this
	  way then with just an exit since we avoid reentrancy issues and
	  all kinds of other fun stuff.  That is we trap the interruption
	  at defined points

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: minor fixes, and recheck config and if some stuff
	  changed (not the full set we care about, maybe we should do that)
	  just restart.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_configuration.h,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item.[ch], gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:  Implement a config button handling.
	  the timed, system and config showing is handled by show
	  types/subtypes so this is handled cleanly.  Request restart on HUP.
	  To allow a name change

	* gui/greeter/themes/circles/GdmGreeterTheme.info:  An idea (not used
	  currently) for the greeter theme information.  This is so that we
	  can do a theme browser and also handle theme installation and all
	  that fun sort of stuff.

	* gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml: add a system show type
	  to the system button

Fri Apr 26 10:18:07 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade): implement the greeter selection option menu

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.c: don't show
	  the system buttons if GdmSystemMenu is FALSE.  We really need
	  to extend the show modes for this.

Thu Apr 25 22:56:30 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: connect the disconnect/quit button

Thu Apr 25 17:20:52 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, gdm.spec.in, gdmsetup-security.in:
	  Whack the gdmconfig again, gdmconfig is now really dead

	* configure.in, docs/Makefile.am: don't build gdmconfig docs

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_canvas_item.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_events.c, gui/greeter/greeter_geometry.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item.h,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_item_capslock.c, gui/greeter/greeter_parser.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_parser.h:  Handle multi-item buttons so that
	  we can catch clicks on the labels next to the buttons in the
	  circles theme.  Add 'show modes' since some items may not be shown
	  depending on what the daemon tells us.  Reformat some code to be in
	  the same style.  Fix a bunch of leaks and some other minor fixes.
	  Also the text is now not taken from a "val" property but from the
	  content since text in a property is just on crack.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.dtd: update a tad but it's still out of date

	* gui/greeter/themes/circles/circles.xml: update for the above
	  changes

2002-04-25  Jacob Berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): add gdmsetup-security

2002-04-24  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add gdmconfig-security.in

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add gdmconfig

Tue Apr 23 15:25:33 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: destroy dialogs after run which is the gtk+2
	  semantics

Tue Apr 23 15:07:17 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, gdmconfig, gdmsetup-security.in, gdmsetup-pam,
	  daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in, gui/Makefile.am,
	  gui/gdmsetup.desktop.in: Make the gdmsetup proggie the default
	  configurator and stop building/installing gdmconfig which wasn't
	  working to begin with.

	* gui/gdmchooser.(c|glade): redo the glade file for gdmchooser to be
	  a dialog and also start using glade-helper

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: some gdmwm related fixes

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_action_language.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c, gui/greeter/greeter_system.c:
	  Add Xinerama support, init the gdmwm so that we actually do
	  have focus management, do all the cool gdmwm type stuff with
	  all the dialogs/windows.  Add all the warnings that gdmlogin
	  can give.  This still needs a LOT of love before it's a viable
	  replacement of gdmlogin.

Mon Apr 22 19:00:14 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: support updating the timed login
	  stuff

	* gui/gdmsetup.(c|glade): implement updating of most things (at
	  least theoretically) except the greeter choosing.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c, gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c,
	  gui/greeter/greeter_session.c: fix warnings

	* gui/gdmcomm.[ch], gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmsetup.c,
	  gui/Makefile.am: split off the comm routines to a separate file,
	  so that we may use this from the setup proggie

	* gui/greeter/greeter_system.c: include unistd.h

Sun Apr 21 23:37:06 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am: distcheck fixes

Sun Apr 21 22:50:49 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm-net.[ch]: add a printf style function

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/xdmcp.c: add functionality for 1) getting
	  a list of greeter pids for use with the setup proggie 2) implement
	  auto updating of most of the xdmcp stuff

	* gui/gdmchooser.(c|glade), gui/Makefile.am: minor fixes, use a glade2
	  instead of converting.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: doh kind of warning fixes

	* gui/gdmsetup.c, gui/Makefile.am: add a beginning of a setup
	  proggie, doesn't yet do much, but it's a start

2002-04-21  Benedikt Roth  <Benedikt.Roth@gmx.net>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: (main):
	Changed button ordering to [Cancel] [ok] (#77151).
	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c: (greeter_item_pam_prompt):
	Applied patch from Gaute Lindkvist <lindkvis@stud.ntnu.no> to give
	focus to the password-field automatically (#73817).

Fri Apr 12 16:00:00 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c: screw the sysmask,
	  just unblock all signals when running a child.  This is what
	  xdm does.  Should fix #77880

Fri Apr 12 15:34:00 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: make sure dialogs

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/greeter/greeter.c: add a function stub for 
	  handling configuration changes

	* gui/gdmsetup.glade: an unfinished new gui configurator to replace
	  gdmconfig.  No it will not have all the options as gdmconfig did
	  since if you want crack you can just use a text editor.

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: handle greeter changes. and
	  implement local vs. remote greeter distinction.  Remove unneeded
	  arguments.

	* config/gdm.conf.in: remote the extra unnecessary args to the
	  greeters

2002-04-10  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver-xnest.desktop.in:
	* gui/gdmflexiserver.desktop.in:
	* gui/gdmphotosetup.desktop.in:

	Install .desktop files in the appropriate GNOME2 location(s),
	adding Category keywords as necessary. Change the description
	of gdmphotosetup to fit better with the other items in the
	"control center".
	
Tue Apr 09 14:27:59 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.[ch]: implement an fdprintf function

	* daemon/gdm-net.[ch]: implement an fd only connection type

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.[ch], daemon/display.c:  implement
	  a notification scheme for slaves so that we can handle changes
	  of some config values on the fly to implement a saner configurator
	  for now implement two values as a sort of testing.

Mon Mar 25 19:05:14 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade2: the info label is wrapped so that it doesn't
	  look like so much crack.  Still is all kind of nasty

2002-03-25  Tõivo Leedjärv  <toivo@linux.ee>

	* config/locale.alias, gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade:
	Added Estonian entries.

2002-03-21  jacob berkman  <jacob@ximian.com>

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c: include signal.h.  i can't find what
	changed, and can't reproduce it on my 7.2 box, but we do use stuff
	from that here and tinderbox is failing

Fri Mar 15 17:15:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade2): A first try at making this actually
	  work.  Edit the generated file in glade-2 and while it is ugly
	  it now actually gets done loading the whole thing.

Tue Mar 12 16:10:22 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Merge in some changes from 2.2 branch

Mon Jan 21 19:14:28 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* acconfig.h, configure.in: use GETTEXT_PACKAGE

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/verify-pam.c,
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/display.c:
	  When displaying something on a console display it only
	  when the console is UTF-8, which is only true if
	  "gdmopen vt-is-UTF8 -q" returns 0 status.  Else don't
	  actually translate anything and just print out the english/ASCII
	  version.

	* daemon/verify-pam.c:  Better check for existence of the pam
	  gdm configuration

	* daemon/gdm.c, gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmchooser.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmphotosetup.c:  property bind gettext stuff and make	
	  sure we correctly set it up for UTF-8

	Use new greeter_parse() API.

2002-01-18  Alex Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

	* configure.in:
	Greeter needs libgnomeui, due to gdmwm!?

	* gui/Makefile.am:
	Build gdmwm as a helper library.

	* gui/greeter/Makefile.am:
	Link to xinerama and libgdmwm.

	* gui/greeter/greeter.c:
	Initial greeter communication.

	* gui/greeter/greeter_item_pam.c:
	Just print out anything gotten from the entry.

2002-01-16  Alex Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_event):
	Correctly read the event, instead of segfaulting.

2002-01-15  Alex Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

	* configure.in:

Sun Jan 13 21:58:36 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.3.90.1

	* daemon/md5.c: a bit of cleanup

2002-01-12  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix a typo in a user visible string.
	
Fri Jan 11 15:03:25 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: make welcome string 3 times bigger.  Also fix
	  browser to actually work, and when moving make sure never to
	  go into negative, it's bad form.

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmconfig.c: use the
	  libglade-convert thingie to make things somewhat work.  Also
	  export symbols to make this somewhat work.  the config still
	  doesn't work, but the chooser mostly should.

Fri Jan 11 12:44:27 2002  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version

	* Merge from 2.2 up to MERGE_3

	2002-01-04  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* configure,in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added "eu".

	Mon Dec 31 18:54:25 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: set egid to the correct value before we do setuid
	  to avoid running the session with gdm group privileges.  (Note
	  that all session files run bash and thus drop those, but this
	  is a problem for the failsafes)

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Make PositionX and PositionY follow the standard
	  X geometry behaviour where negative values mean position from
	  lower/right edge

Thu Dec 27 16:45:04 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.3.90.0

Thu Dec 27 16:43:21 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: don't link libgnomeui and libglade to the
	  daemon any more

	* daemon/errorgui.[ch], daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/verify-*.c: Whack the exec hack for failsafe dialogs,
	  we now yet again do this all just by fork and gtk_init.  This
	  seems to work and is truly failsafe

	* daemon/gdm-net.c: fix hanging caused by some new crack in
	  giochannel, we just do a libc 'read' and that works

	* daemon/server.c, daemon/gdm.[ch]: again some new crack in glib's
	  mainloop was causing g_main_loop_quit to not work right if called
	  from a signal handler (sometimes).  So I just switched to using
	  a simple select call and a dummy pipe.

	* daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/auth.c, daemon/errorgui.c,
	  daemon/gdm-net.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c,
	  daemon/xdmcp.c: Compile without any deprecated stuff from glib up

Thu Dec 27 14:04:27 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am: remove gdmchooser.h

	* Merge from stable up to 2.2.5.3 release tag

	Wed Dec 26 17:20:28 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/veriyfy-crypt.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c: include
	  errorgui.h

Fri Dec 21 18:09:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c,
	  gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmwm.c:  Remove more deprecated things
	  and minor fixes that were related.  Doesn't actually compile
	  without deprecated things yet, but it's closer now.

Thu Dec 20 19:51:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/gdm.c: some s/ve_setenv/gnome_setenv/

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/slave.c: optionally preserve
	  LD_ variables.  This is mostly for testing and normally isn't
	  done.  Also add the nodaemon option as a popt option so that it
	  actually works, and some cleanup in the main function.

	* daemon/server.c: some debug output

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix keyboard input bug, fix compile with new
	  libgnomeui, actually use the scrollbar

Thu Dec 20 16:49:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Merge from stable from 2.2.5.2 release tag up

	Thu Dec 20 16:27:40 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: apparently the actually correct
	  order (Which actually makes sense) is setcred/open_session.
	  This is apparently the 'official' word from the linux-pam
	  people.  Though not everybody agrees.  Well screw this,
	  this makes sense, so this is the way it will be.

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: fix saving of server definitions

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: add ability to have newlines in the 
	  welcome string by just adding \n into the strings

	Thu Dec 06 22:09:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Fix TimedLogin I broke on last commit

	* daemon/verify-pam.c:  For autologin, still call authenticate,
	  but use the service gdm-autologin.  Also a bit of cleanup.

	* config/gdm-autologin, config/Makefile.am:  A promiscuous
	  service.  This will let anyone in, gdm uses this for autologin
	  or timed login when we want to let a user in without a password,
	  this way we can follow all the proper pam doodaah with
	  pam_authenticate and all that so we can safely call setcred

	Tue Dec 04 20:46:57 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/display.c:  On events where
	  we fail due to bad configuration, run the text message dialog.
	  Also if we hit the loop of death outside of XFAILED on a local
	  display, run a text message telling the user so instead of just
	  putting this into the syslog.  We need more interaction here I
	  think.  But this is better then nothing.

	Tue Dec 04 18:44:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/verify-crypt.c, 
	  daemon/verify-shadow.c, daemon/verify.h, daemon/misc.[ch],
	  daemon/slave.c:  revamp the PAM support based on a patch
	  from Karsten Petersen <karsten.petersen@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>.
	  Move the open session and setcred back to verify, implement
	  account checking more properly, especially for auto logins.  We
	  assume the pamh existing when needed.  And don't do the weird
	  ensure hack.  Also setgid and initgroups in the verify/setup
	  function.  rename the open_session function to setup_env, since
	  that's what it does.  Also implement more checking of errors
	  during login process.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/errorgui.c: make sure that we're not 'setuid'
	  looking in the failsafes.  Also correctly setup "PATH" from stored
	  path.

	* daemon/slave.c: fix race where USR2 was expected from a
	  non-existent parent.  This can happen when you do 'killall gdm'

Mon Dec 10 08:23:00 2001 Trevor Curtis <tcurtis@somaradio.ca>
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: updated the doc to use the FDL, and cleaned up a
	few things

Fri Dec 7 23:02:12 2001 Trevor Curtis <tcurtis@somaradio.ca>
	* doc/C/gdmconfig/C/gdm.xml: removed Tim Jansen from documentation
	at his request

Fri Dec 7 06:33:13 2001 Trevor Curtis <tcurtis@soamradio.ca>
	* docs/C/gdmconfig/C/gdm.xml: created xml version of gdmconfig 
	documentation

Fri Dec  7 05:05:26 2001  Trevor Curtis <tcurtis@somaradio.ca>
	* docs/C/gdm.xml: created xml version of gdm documentation

Fri Nov 30 17:38:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am, daemon/Makefile.am: fix xinerama
	  compilation

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: define GTK_ENABLE_BROKEN to be able to use GtkText
	  for now

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix some s/int/gsize/, accelerators bind to
	  "activate" signal, and use GNOME_PARAM_ENABLE_SOUND instead
	  of the argv hack

Thu Nov 22 00:47:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Merge from stable up to 2.2.5.2 release tag

	Wed Nov 21 21:12:58 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c: Fix minor leaks

	Wed Nov 21 20:58:24 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmwm.c: Support the InputHint to support No Input windows,
	  so that we can support things like xscribble and keyboards and
	  other accessibility and such doodaahs.  Based on a patch from
	  Crossfire <xfire@xware.cx>

	Wed Nov 21 19:46:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/server.c: keep 4 old x server logs in a logrotate like
	  manner to make debugging X server problems easier

	2001-11-17  Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@gnome-db.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added pt.

Fri Nov 16 12:38:30 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Yay! it like all builds and stuff

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix crash for timed logins

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade):  Remove the font option, it can now be
	  done by using the pango markup in the welcome message

	* gui/gdmchooser.h gui/gdmlogin.h, gui/Makefile.am: remove useless
	  header files.

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: reorganize the code a bit to remove useless
	  forward declarations

	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.[ch],
	  gui/gdmflexiserver.c, gui/gdmwm.[ch], gui/misc.h:  Port to
	  pixbuf and gnome2.

	* utils/Makefile.am: remove (includedir) to make it not pickup gnome1
	  headers

Fri Nov 16 02:15:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: include unistd.h

	* Makefile.am, gui/Makefile.am: update for intltool

	* configure.in: vicious-extensions doesn't define the envvar
	  functions

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/server.c, 
	  daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmconfig.c,
	  gui/gdmlogin.c:  Use change to use the glib functions where
	  old ve_* or gnome_* functions were used and also change to
	  use the gnome_(setenv|unsetenv|clearenv) functions.

	* gui/gdmwm.c: port to gnome2

	* gui/gdmchooser.[ch]: port to gnome2 a bit, remove imlib dep, sanitize
	  the interface broadcast stuff

	* daemon/gdm.c: clean up the signal stuff source thing

Thu Nov 15 23:25:41 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: some build fixes

	* **/*.c: remove RCSid's as they are un-fun for merging

	* Merge from gdm-2-2:

	Thu Nov 15 21:18:48 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.[ch], daemon/server.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:
	  clean up a bit of the constants mess (though it's still an utter
	  mess).  Implement a new SUP opcode so that the daemon knows
	  when the server was started so that it can start local servers
	  in order, so that things like complete machine lockups don't occur
	  (I got one just testing this).  Also add a 3 second 'padding'
	  between server starts to really be sure.

	* config/gdm.conf.in:  add some comments, mostly for distributions

	2001-11-06  Gregory Leblanc  <gleblanc@linuxweasel.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: more minor updates.  There's a ChangeLog in the
	  file, if you care that much.

Mon Nov 05 21:28:43 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, **/Makefile.am, daemon/*.[ch], utils/*.[ch],
	  gui/*.[ch]:  Begin GNOME 2.0 porting.  Not complete yet,
	  daemon may 'compile', gui doesn't compile yet

Thu Nov 01 01:06:21 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.5.1

Sun Oct 28 12:15:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: when the server refuses to be started, some error
	  in the start code.  Tell the user that we have no clue what's
	  happening and give up.

Sun Oct 28 11:56:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/xdmcp.[ch]: be more
	  thorough in setting up address/cookie pairs for local servers,
	  and make sure to always setup localhost.localdomain and
	  loopback.  Don't use hostname based lookup on local servers,
	  but use the same code we use for xdmcp peeking local addresses.
	  This will make it possible to start an X server and login
	  even if the hostname is out of whack.

Sun Oct 28 10:46:21 2001  Christophe Merlet <christophe@merlet.net>

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: corrected just a little typo.

Sat Oct 27 21:44:20 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-*.c: put the sleep day in the verify	
	  code, and in pam verification use the pam sleep to do the same
	  if available.  This means that the error will come after the sleep
	  but that the sleep will be 1) random 2) not doubled with both the
	  gdm and the pam sleep.  Second always print the "Please enter your
	  username" message on the verify not just the first time.

Sat Oct 27 14:56:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version to 2.2.5.1

	* daemon/errorgui.[ch], daemon/gdm.c: add yesno error dialog

	* daemon/auth.[ch], daemon/slave.c: allow logins without a home
	  dir (it will be set to '/') but only after properly warning the
	  user about it, and asking him if he wants to continue.

Sat Oct 27 13:22:48 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-*.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c:
	  Make pam errors and such pop up in a dialog box to make sure
	  the user notices them.  If the login gets a QUIT and it had some
	  informative messages to tell the user but there was no prompt
	  in between (that is, the user hasn't read them), display it in
	  a dialog.

	* daemon/gdmlogin.c: fix focus after uniconify

Fri Oct 26 01:01:53 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in: run ssh-agent if available, also remove some
	  bashisms, patch taken and modified from Ximian SRPM

Fri Oct 26 00:30:45 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: try also appending .png to the face file to support
	  KDE like faces (fixed version of Mandrake SRPM patch)

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Accept KP_Enter as return as well (from Mandrake)

	* daemon/server.c: change perms on open to 0644, those were the perms
	  actually used anyway because of umask, but this makes the code
	  easier to read.

	* config/XKeepsCrashing:  fix some logic, fix for filenames with
	  spaces, test for XFdrake so that this works seamlessly on Mandrake,
	  also add xf86cfg to the list of configurators, also kill some
	  bashism.  If we can't find a configurator still offer to display
	  the server output and then disable the server.

	* gdmconfig-security.in: make FALLBACK false, as it doesn't make
	  sense to have fallback, also make SESSION true as per redhat
	  patches

	* gdmconfig-pam: apply the redhat patch.  It seems to me that is
	  the more correct way to handle it in general.  Scream at me if
	  it is wrong.

	* configure.in: make console helper automatically detected and
	  used if present.

Thu Oct 25 20:28:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/display.c, daemon/errorgui.c,
	  daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c:  Super fork race
	  killing patch, suspend both SIGCHLD and TERM/INT/HUP over 
	  forks, suspend CHLD over short waitpids.  Fix races where
	  the switch logic after forks may have gotten confused.  A tiny bit
	  of unrelated cleanup as well.

Thu Oct 25 01:49:57 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing: fix minor issues

	* daemon/gdm.c: set TEXTDOMAIN and TEXTDOMAINDIR for XKeepsCrashing

	* utils/gdmopen.c: echo \033(K onto the console to make sure
	  that non lat1 fonts get set up

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c:  When starting
	  a server consider loss of connection within 5 seconds a crash
	  no matter what.  It seems that for example not being able
	  to open a mouse manifests self AFTER server tells us
	  it's ready and we XOpenDisplay.  Actually it's 5 seconds from
	  the USR1, which means 5 seconds after it's ready to accept
	  connections.

Wed Oct 24 17:57:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade), config/gdm.conf.in:
	  Don't pass extra arguments to XKeepsCrashing, and whack the X
	  configurators option since that is now changed by editing the
	  XKeepsCrashing script directly.

	* config/XKeepsCrashing, config/Makefile.am, config/gettextfoo.h,
	  po/POTFILES.in, config/extract-shell.sh:  Rework the XKeepsCrashing
	  script, configurator is found from a list in the script.  If the
	  error is a mouse error try the mouseconfig configurator first. 
	  Messages are now gotten by gettext -s directly and extracted
	  by a simple stupid script, that needs a tad of work still I think.

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml:  Remove the XKeepsCrashingConfigurators option

Wed Oct 24 11:39:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* utils/gdmmktemp.c, utils/Makefile.am: rename to gdmmktemp,
	  make it build, and install in /bin

Wed Oct 24 11:02:55 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* utils/gdmkstemp.c, utils/Makefile.am:  add a small utility
	  for safely making temp files

Wed Oct 24 01:22:41 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: remove documentation of the VerboseAuth option

Wed Oct 24 01:26:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* bin/gdm.[ch], bin/verify-*.c, config/gdm.conf.in,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):  Remove the VerboseAuth conf variable,
	  it provided absolutely zero extra security (since it didn't divulge
	  any info the user cannot get by other means, and making it
	  false just made the whole thing less usable and more confusing)

	* bin/gdm.c: include locale.h

Tue Oct 23 15:17:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: add --broadcast, --direct and
	  --no-gdm-check, rename --no-chooser to --no-query, fix
	  backgrounding vs. gtk and don't do checks when we don't need
	  to (on no-query, broadcast or no-gdm-check)

Tue Oct 23 02:32:05 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c: make this more useful, make it possible
	  to specify a custom Xnest/options to run and default to running
	  the one from the config.  Also add option to background the
	  process, and an option to run no chooser, just Xnest, and have it
	  print out the DISPLAY setting to use for the display.

Sat Oct 20 16:26:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am: a bit of makefile cleanup and
	  make sure we REQUIRE libglade in the configure.in

Sat Oct 20 14:11:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/server.c: a bit of debug output.

	* daemon/slave.c: check the home dir, if it doesn't exist (or is not
	  a directory, then tell the user and try again.  Maybe we should
	  continue and let the session fail, should we?  I don't see any
	  merit in trying to log in with no home dir.  Also, clean up verify
	  on auth problems, in term handler don't reset the signal mask,
	  and fix some possible races and whack the chooser, same in
	  xioerror handler.  In slave_exit, mask the CHLD signal to avoid
	  races, and other race fixes

Sat Oct 20 13:31:07 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* utils/gdmopen.c: set VT_NUMBER env var

	* gui/gdmwm.c: Fix a race for MapNotify so that newly created windows
	  are always focused

Sat Oct 20 12:03:14 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/Makefile.am: DESTDIR added patch by: frodol@dds.nl (Frodo
	  Looijaard)

Sat Oct 20 11:57:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Patches from: Heath Nielson <heath@cs.byu.edu>

	* daemon/slave.c:  Fix from the FreeBSD bugtracker to fix a crash
	  related to setenv (foo, NULL, 1).

	* daemon/gdm-net.c:  Fix from the FreeBSD bugtracker to fix creation
	  of the local socket

Mon Oct 15 23:32:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.4.3

Mon Oct 15 23:28:45 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: the xdmcp indirect and manage waits were
	  too long, changed to 15 seconds.  If you can't finish the
	  xdmcp conversation in 15 seconds, you don't really have a
	  connection you want to use X on.

Fri Oct 12 12:52:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, daemon/Makefile.am, gui/Makefile.am,
	  utils/Makefile.am:  Apply patch from Ali Akcaagac
	  <ali.akcaagac@stud.fh-wilhelmshaven.de> for compatibility
	  with automake 1.5 and autoconf 2.50

	* config/locale.alias, gui/languages.c:  Make russian use KOI8-R and
	  add ukrainian

Mon Oct 08 20:54:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c:  Fix small leak

	* daemon/server.[ch], daemon/slave.c: wipe cookies better and safer

	* daemon/server.c: server killing right after launch race fixed,
	  probably was harmless though, also reset the vt number on linux
	  before starting a new server.

	* daemon/slave.c: increase the loop of death time for logouts, and
	  always redo parsed automatic/timed login vars after each display
	  start as the display number / hostname might have changed.  When
	  we can't open a display, it's XFAILED rather then REMANAGE so
	  that we go into the "your X sucks" dialog.  We need better
	  error reporting though.

Sun Oct 07 16:55:24 2001  Fatih Demir <kabalak@gtranslator.org>

	* configure.in: Added "ta" to the languages list.

Fri Oct 05 13:58:41 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: user PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED for pam_setcred

Thu Oct 04 13:19:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.4.2

Thu Oct 04 13:18:30 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c: the mode for sticky 01777 not 02777.  Whoops.

Thu Oct 04 00:12:05 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c, gui/gdmXnestserver.c: also check stale lock files
	  when looking for empty display names

Wed Oct 03 23:54:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: fix segfault on send_got_manged_forward

Wed Oct 03 20:26:27 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/slave.[ch]: ensure the /tmp/.ICE-unix
	  directory.  Hopefully we're correct.

	* daemon/server.c: when running server as root, unset supplementary
	  groups and set group to 0.  So that the files X creates it creates
	  with gid 0 as well rather then with the 'gdm' group name.

Wed Sep 26 23:54:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm-net.c, gui/gdmflexiserver.c: deal with the case where
	  MSG_NOSIGNAL is not defined by temporarily ignoring the SIGPIPE
	  signal.  Fixes #60586

Wed Sep 26 21:01:38 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify.h, daemon/verify-*.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/errorgui.[ch], daemon/gdm.c:  Add a failsafe question
	  dialog similar in operation to the failsafe error box, and use
	  it in the standalone pam conv function.  Kill all instances of
	  PAM_SILENT since we can now always converse with the user.

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: use a global pamh again but this time a bit
	  smarter.  Make sure if we use a global one that it has all the
	  right things set.  Also set PAM_RHOST to "localhost" or the remote
	  host if not a "console" login.  Set PAM_RUSER to "gdm" (or whatever
	  the gdm user is).  I'm sure I'm messing something up again but
	  I can't find enough docs to verify that what I'm doing is 100%
	  correct.  Not to mention that there seem to be some braindead
	  modules out there to begin with.

Mon Sep 17 07:17:32 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix crash when quiver would happen while
	  iconized

	* daemon/misc.c: include signal.h

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: don't go nuts on just minor version change, only
	  tell the user to when the greeter protocol version changed.

Thu Sep 13 00:20:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Apply patch from Ali Akcaagac
	  <ali.akcaagac@stud.fh-wilhelmshaven.de> to fix up the 24hr time
	  display to not show the %p

Tue Sep 11 02:34:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade),
	  gui/gdmlogin.c, docs/C/gdm.sgml:  Apply and finish a patch from
	  Terje Rosten <terjeros@phys.ntnu.no> to add an option to force
	  24 hour clock on the greeter

Tue Sep 11 01:37:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/errorgui.c: use the safe fork function

	* daemon/gdm.c: a doh kind of error, waitpid returns 0 to mean
	  'no child', not -1 as I assumed.

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c:  another doh!, actually whack the screen
	  portion of the display number

Mon Sep 10 20:20:59 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/auth.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/display.c, 
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmflexiserver.c:  Implement
	  a new scheme for the FLEXI_XNEST command.  Old implementations
	  will get ERROR 100 (I doubt there are any).  This solves some
	  security issues with the Xnest stuff.  The Xnest server is now
	  run as the user who owns the .Xauthority file, but only if that
	  file is readable ONLY by the user and only if the user can
	  access keys inside it.  An MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 must exist for
	  the current display on which Xnest will run.  This is of course
	  true for gdm created sessions.
	  
	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/display.c:  Implement a race safe fork, and improve the
	  signal handlers to handle some more corner cases and avoid some
	  races.  Also remove the old last_killed_pid hack since it's now
	  handled nicer.

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: add a protocol

Sat Sep 08 02:35:51 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: OK, PAM documentation is officially on crack.
	  Some places (the kernel.org web manual) say order should be
	  set_cred -> open_session, but it seems that the order is
	  open_session -> set_cred.  Should fix #59977

Sat Sep 08 02:06:44 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: use pclose on popen'ed FILE *

Thu Sep 06 20:17:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: handle error from fork when daemonizing well

Thu Sep 06 15:55:20 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmwm.c: "fix" for the toolbar deadlock problem.  apparently
	  gnome-dock code is pretty braindead and uses the bulldog technique
	  for grabbing the pointer, grab in a tight loop until we succeed.
	  But the it will fail until the main loop is hit so a deadlock
	  results.  Fix this by defining that function again in gdmwm with
	  a more "maybe" correct semantics.

Tue Sep  4 18:52:10 2001  Trevor Curtis <tcurtis@somaradio.ca>
	* docs/gdmconfig/C/figures/GDM_xserv_setup.png,GDM_xdmcp.png: 
	  Updated the above screenshots to reflect recent changes.

Wed Sep  5 03:18:43 2001  Abel Cheung <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* config/locale.alias: Rename zh_TW.Big5 to zh_TW .

Mon Sep 03 00:38:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c:  When we run a new flexi server lock the
	  current screen with xscreensaver.  We need a nicer locker though
	  and one that can also run gdmflexiserver.  And this even for normal
	  gnome locking.  It would be nice if xscreensaver allowed a custom
	  locker dialog.

Mon Sep  3 01:34:17 EDT 2001 Trevor Curtis <tcurtis@somaradio.ca>
	* gdmconfig.sgml: updated the gdmconfig document to reflect
	  the changes in the gui, gdmconfig.

Sun Sep 02 16:44:28 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/xdmcp.c: Implement a GOT_MANAGED_FORWARD
	  opcode.  Also send MANAGED_FORWARD 3 times (1.5 sec spaced apart)
	  or until we get a GOT_MANAGED_FORWARD.  This is a compatible
	  change to the gdm xdmcp protocol so version wasn't raised.

Sat Sep 01 14:53:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* AUTHORS, docs/gdmconfig/C/gdmconfig.sgml:  Updated trevors email

Sat Sep 01 07:00:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: the decline messages were switched still.  I've
	  been up too late

Sat Sep 01 05:31:07 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.4.1

Sat Sep 01 05:29:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.[ch], daemon/choose.c:  Fix decline strings, and
	  make the MANAGED_FORWARD work if the origin address is local.

Sat Sep 01 04:15:38 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/choose.[ch]: Change the gdm
	  extension protocol, the MANAGED_FORWARD passes address of origin
	  rather then hostname of self.  And we now handle the message
	  correctly.  Also on DECLINE, send a descriptive english string
	  to aid in debugging XDMCP setup.

	* configure.in: raise version

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add the DisplaysPerHost default

Sat Sep 01 00:47:36 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c: Implement
	  DisplaysPerHost which was documented so it should have worked
	  in the first place

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/auth.c, daemon/gdm.c,
	  daemon/choose.c, daemon/cookie.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmlogin.c: fix some memleaks, none really dangerous

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: messages such as status information shouldn't be
	  translated.  Because they go over a wire with no specification of
	  charset or language.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Fix broken "session don't exist wanna save new one"
	  message

	* daemon/gdm.c: Make sure static display numbers are unique.
	  and fix a possible crash in flexible server code

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: a small update

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Add -a (--authenticate) command so that
	  when using the --command option we can auth first, useful for
	  testing.

Fri Aug 31 20:22:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: Update for all the server def stuff.

Fri Aug 31 18:21:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: run the Willing script at most once every 3
	  seconds.  That way we can prevent some DOS attacks.

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: update

Fri Aug 31 18:12:05 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/xdmcp.c:  Add an
	  xdmcp/Willing script configuration option.  To run a script
	  when the system gets the QUERY command.  Original patch
	  by Matt Forrest <mforrest@scs.ryerson.ca>, but heavily modified.

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fix checks for the chooser and greeter binaries

	* gui/gdmconfig.{glade,c}:  Add configuration for the Willing
	  thing

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml:  Document some of the new configuration keys.
	  Not everything is documented yet.

Fri Aug 31 17:04:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Fix reading and changing servers with respect
	  to server numbers.  All server numbers are now normalized and
	  they equal the actual row (such assumptions were made before,
	  but were not enforced).  Also fix some memory leaks.

Fri Aug 31 16:34:58 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: fix writing of servers to config file

2001-08-31  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): zh_TW.Big5 -> zh_TW

Tue Aug 28 23:17:41 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: s/login/username/ one more time, and in XDMCP
	  mode call it "Disconnect" not "Quit", but in flexi mode, it should
	  still be "Quit".

Tue Aug 28 19:23:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: redo restart logic to be a lot smarter and not hang
	  on leftover fifo's

Tue Aug 28 17:37:12 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.4.0

2001-08-27  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* daemon/filecheck.c (gdm_file_check): make the meaning of a syslog
	  string a bit clearer. (hope not in string freeze now)

Sun Aug 26 01:45:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/cookie.c:   Minor cleanup and paranoia

	* daemon/gdm-net.[ch], daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/slave.[ch]: The daemon now keeps track of the cookies in 
	  text form at least so that it can do authentication of it's own.
	  FLEXI_XSERVER now requires an "authenticated" socket connection
	  using AUTH_LOCAL (a new opcode).  This way only those users that
	  are logged in from gdm on a console can start new
	  console/fullscreen flexi servers.  I mean for remote people it
	  wouldn't work anyway.

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: implement AUTH_LOCAL authentication scheme
	  by reading from the .Xauthority file and looking for FamilyLocal
	  entries from gdm. (or those looking like it).  Tests all candidates
	  and find the one that works for gdm.  This could cause some
	  gdm_info messages in the log, but I suppose that's ok, vast
	  majority of the time there will only be one that is even tried.
	  Also added a debug flag and get xauth filename from XauFileName
	  rather then my own hand created method.

Sat Aug 25 21:35:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c: don't use an extra printf, if
	  this was user supplied it could have been a security hole, like
	  this it was just one extra allocation.

	* gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/gdmchooser.c: cast address argument
	  to connect to avoid a warning.

Sat Aug 25 10:06:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.c:  Fix wiping of pid file on
	  "gdm already exists" message

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/gdm-net.c:  Don't unlink files on close.
	  Instead only unlink things on final_cleanup.  This fixes the
	  disappearing socket trick.

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c:  When not local refuse to run.  This is still
	  not perfect.  But I don't suppose we'll get much better.
	  Unfortunately a new string.  The translators will beat me up.

Fri Aug 24 19:32:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/sgmldocs.make: update to newest from gnome-core

Thu Aug 23 12:03:41 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: add gdmopen and gdkaskpass to the summary

Thu Aug 23 10:10:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in:  Update for the server stuff

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/errorgui.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/slave.c:
	  close fds no longer needed.  Close all needed things after
	  forking,  Some other related cleanup as well.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  A minor UI cleanup, make the entry at least
	  250 pixels wide, in an attempt t make the window not change size
	  all the time

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c:  Don't require the browser to be on.  Just
	  warn the user that the browser is off, but still let him pick
	  the face.

Wed Aug 22 23:23:21 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing, daemon/misc.c: Also test for whiptail if
	  we can't find dialog nor gdialog

	* daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/gdm.c:  Make sure things that run dialog
	  (and could thus run gdialog) don't have DISPLAY set

Wed Aug 22 23:01:59 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, utils/gdmopen.c, utils/gdmaskpass.c:
	  Add two new small sbin utils.  gdmopen is like open (based on it)
	  but better suited for gdm.  Exitcode is returned so no temp files
	  are needed.  Process is cleaned up on a signal, the new vt is
	  deallocated after use.  And unlike openvt this thing actually waits
	  for the child.  Gdmaskpass just asks for the root password, for
	  use in the XKeepsCrashing script.  Both of these things will only
	  run as root as I'm too paranoid and it doesn't make sense for
	  them to run otherwise for gdm anyway.

	* configure.in: Fix sbin expansion.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c:
	  Use gdmopen to run dialog and add helper functions for doing this.

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.[ch]:  When a server is
	  busy, ask the user if we want to run it on a new display number
	  or retry.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.c, daemon/slave.c: Make sure to whack
	  any extra helper processes we launch when we are killed so that
	  we don't leave things like 'dialog' processes around

	* daemon/gdm.c, config/XKeepsCrashing:  Use gdmaskpass, ask if
	  the user wants to view X logs if X is crashing.  And use gdmopen
	  in the script and correctly abort with exit 32.  Also make it
	  not use the ugly tempfile stuff (Though a tempfile is still given
	  to the script for now)

	* gdm.spec.in: raise epoch to 1, people abuse this field, and if they
	  do abuse it again and raise it beyond 1, I'll just max it out since
	  it makes package upgrading not work.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-(pam|crypt|shadow).c: add
	  /sbin/nologin as a thing to test for for disabled logins in
	  addition to /bin/false and /bin/true (it worked, but this adds a
	  nicer message)

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: fix a warning.

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.desktop.in: kill TryExec here

Tue Aug 21 04:42:05 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.[ch]:  Finish the editing of the server definitions.
	  BTW, this is incredibly evil and ugly code and should be cleaned
	  up one of these days.  I feel sort of dirty for doing it :)

Tue Aug 21 03:03:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version number

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.[ch],
	  daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c:  Send back info about current
	  user and get the VT number on linux.  Implement a command in
	  the control protocol for getting a list of console logins

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: add an option for sending arbitrary commands
	  to gdm for testing, and remove debugging output

Mon Aug 20 01:10:24 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: finish editing of static servers and a bit
	  of work on server definitions editing.

Sun Aug 19 14:47:09 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): work more on server editing, now fills
	  out the static server edit dialog correctly

2001-08-19  Jesus Bravo Alvarez  <jba@pobox.com>

	* config/locale.alias, gui/gdmlanguages.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade,
	  gui/gdmconfig-strings.c: Added Galician (gl_ES) and Brazilian
	  Portuguese (pt_BR) entries.

Sat Aug 18 18:17:44 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: add some code for choosable servers (not
	  implemented yet

	* daemon/misc.c: search our own displays for used numbers first

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c:  Finish implementing
	  choosing of flexi servers

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify{,-pam,-crypt,-shadow}.[ch]:
	  Correctly implement credential setting and some pam related	
	  fixes

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade): Start on making configuration for 
	  all the new stuff including the server definitions, not finished
	  yet.

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: if there are multiple flexible servers,
	  give the user a choice

	* gui/gdmflexiserver-xnest.desktop.in: only show if Xnest exists

Fri Aug 17 23:56:14 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Add a standard server definition and the Xnest
	  key

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c:  Add server definition reading
	  and using

Fri Aug 17 14:47:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/Makefile.am: fix rules since the .sgml file changed

Fri Aug 17 04:42:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/auth.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm-net.[ch],
	  daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.[ch], daemon/slave.[ch]:
 	  Finish implementation of flexible servers and lots of related
	  cleanup and restructuring that was related.

	* daemon/server.c: close all fd's when running the X server.

	* gui/gdmflexiserver.c: implement the updated protocol and implement
	  all the error codes

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmflexiserver(|-xnest).desktop.in,
	  po/POTFILEs.in:  Add launchers for new flexi server and new
	  xnest flexiserver

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/slave.c: On flexi servers add the "Quit"
	  menu thingie, since it's just as useful as in xdmcp case here.
	  It should probably be a close button, not a Quit button.  I dunno.

Thu Aug 16 01:29:05 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gui/gdmXnestchooser.c, gui/Makefile.am:  Add a proggie
	  for starting an Xnest chooser session.

	* daemon/gdm-net.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], gui/Makefile.am,
	  gui/gdmflexiserver.c: Make the protocol actually work right and
	  add a small proggie for starting new flexi X servers.

Wed Aug 15 13:14:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: When writing to .gnome/photo, first unlink the
	  file

Wed Aug 15 01:54:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Added StandardXServer and FlexibleXServers
	  and font includes a ,*.  Also Xservers use the "Standard"
	  definition, which all probably doesn't work

	* daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/gdm-net.[ch]: Move the fifo stuff here
	  and generalize it and add an interface for unix sockets

	* daemon/gdm.[ch]: Add support for the user protocol using unix
	  domain sockets

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/auth.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/slave.c:  Do some Standard and Flexible/Xnest servers dance. 
	  Mostly doesn't work now still.

	* daemon/misc.c: implement an incredibly evil function to figure out
	  a free X display number

2001-08-14  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: Fix sgml up a bit.
	* docs/gdmconfig/C/gdmconfig.sgml: Fix up here too.
	
Mon Aug 13 13:13:25 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.3.2

Sun Aug 12 11:44:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: use ve_gnome_dialog_grab_focus

Fri Aug 10 22:56:21 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: use selected state for titlebar when window
	  focused, normal when otherwise, get rid of handle crack and the
	  frame to make titlebar slimer.

Fri Aug 10 11:51:20 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Apply the following patch and massage it a bit to be more sane

	Mon Jul 30 14:29:00 2001  Heeten Choxi <azari.geo@yahoo.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c: created new Opcode for communication
	between daemon and greeter called GDM_ERRBOX.
	
	* daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c:
	Use GDM_ERRBOX to send error feedback to greeter when logins fail.
	(As suggested in GNOME Usability Study Report :: Logging In)
	
	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Added an "Ok" button that can be pushed to continue
	with login.  (As suggested in GNOME Usability Report)

Sat Aug 04 19:47:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: In the rest of
	  syslog usage use the "%s" format string to print a string

Sat Aug 04 19:36:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in: run the scripts from /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d
	  which makes some more things work right

Fri Aug  3 12:51:58 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* daemon/slave.c (gdm_slave_exec_script): Set
	RUNNING_UNDER_GDM - we might want to know this
	when we, for instance, running the display init
	script.

2001-08-03  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Added Norwegian translations.
	
2001-08-02  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_login_session_init): add config option to
	not show the Last session item, because it's confusing to have in
	addition to Default, and interacts badly with switchdesk and
	kdm/xdm. Need a better solution, such as a unified session system
	across kdm/gdm. Lang-setting is screwed up too (e.g.
	/etc/sysconfig/i18n overrides it, and does not work for non-GNOME
	sessions).

2001-08-02  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c (gdm_config_parse): fix format

	* daemon/server.c (display_busy): fix format 

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c (gdm_verify_user): don't put login 
	in syslog, because people accidentally type their password 
	in this field.

	* daemon/verify-shadow.c (gdm_verify_user): same

	* daemon/verify-pam.c (gdm_verify_user): same
	
	* daemon/misc.c: syslog takes a format string, don't pass it data
	we got from the user. Reported by Cyril Diakhate
	<diakhate@easynet.fr>

Thu Aug  2 03:10:23 2001  Abel Cheung <maddog@linux.org.hk>

	* daemon/display.c: GdmDisplay->name should be a %s, not %d (I think)

Tue Jul 24 20:25:00 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/gdm.h: embrace and extend xdmcp.  Add
	  an opcode for a successful forwarded session so that the original
	  manager can discard the indirect easily and fix some relevant bugs.
	  Still not sure about the design, will make it more robust later.

Tue Jul 24 05:21:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: Don't link Give/TakeConsole as those are stupid.
	  fixes bad ownership of /dev/console (which is handled by pam
	  anyway!) and fixes sessreg related bugs as well.

Mon Jul 23 12:42:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: s/Halt/Shut down/ and don't ask for saving
	  failsafe sessions.

Wed Jul 11 12:55:36 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/verify-crypt.c: when user doesn't exist
	  ask for a password anyway.  Also some sanity fixing all around.

Mon Jul  9 09:20:49 2001  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* config/locale.alias: Fix typo - traditional, not traditonal.

Mon Jul 09 00:14:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, autogen.sh, configure.in, daemon/Makefile.am,
	  daemon/auth.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/misc.c,
	  daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-crypt.c,
	  daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c, daemon/xdmcp.c,
	  gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  gui/gdmphotosetup.c, gui/misc.[ch], po/POTFILES.in:  Use
	  vicious-extensions module rather then local routines

	* gui/icon-entry-hack.[ch]: remove, in vicious-extensions now

Sun Jul 08 16:38:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.3.1 

	* config/locale.alias, gui/gdmlanguages.c: added simplified and
	  traditional chinese

Fri Jul 06 04:25:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: Fix fd leak after dup2

Fri Jul 06 01:55:27 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Correct checks for chooser greeter binaries, and
	  fix Suspend feature

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/misc.[ch], gui/misc.[ch], daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: Use popt for
	  splitting argv's, this makes things understand quotes which are
	  apparently already used in places (eek).  This underlines the need
	  for the vicious-extensions-module, I just cut and paste too much
	  code.  Watch for this new cvs module soon.

	* daemon/slave.c: fix code for sessions with spaces in them

Thu Jul 05 23:45:45 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: open 0,1,2 with correct rw flag

	* daemon/slave.c: Ryan Murray pointed me to some of my braindamage
	  which was causing gdm to fail in horrible ways on debian.  Get rid
	  of the greeter FILE * which caused us to close fd 0 at one point
	  which then caused us to prematurely close our X connection.  We
	  just use stdin now, which makes more sense.

Thu Jul 05 18:50:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: remove the connection to RedHat's default init as that
	  just does some background setting but we already set background
	  ourselves in a nicer way and this just resulted in a slowdown and
	  a flash

	* daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c: be more thorough in closing
	  displays, never include an empty xioerror handler, and normally
	  xio errors do a DISPLAY_REMANAGE and only on server startup do they
	  do XFAILED.  Also before and after whacking clients grab/ungrab the
	  server as xdm does.

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: fix warnings

Thu Jul 05 13:17:53 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: add kill_thingies to atexit to make sure that the
	  background thing gets killed on X errors

Thu Jul 05 03:29:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: raise version to 2.2.3.1

	* gdm.spec.in: do a "soft restart" in %post

	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: warning fixes

	* daemon/misc.h, daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/choose.c,
	  daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c,saemon/server.c: fix printf style
	  warnings

	* daemon/choose.[ch], display/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: change the
	  fifo protocol to be text based so that we can also control from
	  scripts like the .spec file.  Also store all the different pids
	  in the daemon so that we can whack all the different processes
	  the slave starts if it crashes.  Also add a soft restart opcode.

Wed Jul 04 20:58:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm-safe-restart.in, Makefile.am, configure.in, daemon/choose.[ch], 
	  daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, gui/gdmconfig.c:
	  The fifo is not only for chooser now, it is a general protocol to
	  control some gdm things, more to come.  It's writing direct binary
	  structs, but then again this is only a fifo and you should only be
	  able to write to it from gdm and root account on the same machine.
	  The daemon now knows when a user is logged in on a display and
	  there is a safe restart option with SIGUSR1 to the daemon.  Also
	  the daemon knows the x pids now and can whack the X server when
	  the slave crashes, so that we don't get busy hanging server.

	* daemon/misc.c: fails are LOG_CRIT not LOG_ERR (I hope this is
	  correct)

Tue Jul 03 13:18:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, config/Makefile.am: prepend $DESTDIR to $PAM_PREFIX

Tue Jul 03 03:33:13 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in: Made HonorIndirect default
	  to true now

Tue Jul 03 02:18:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.3

Tue Jul 03 02:14:41 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h: Hosts,Broadcast were in the wrong section

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: check for current displays BEFORE we check the
	  number of pending and allocate a new display, this way we'll remove
	  it if it itself has been pending, also don't just dispose, the
	  display may be already managed, in which case we want to unmanage
	  it to avoid a process leak.

	* gdm.spec.in: fix pam prefix stuff and file listing

	* config/Makefile.am: fix pam installation stuff

Mon Jul 02 14:36:57 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: In remote (xdmcp) mode, allow killing of the
	  login window by a "Quit" on the menubar.  I will make this
	  string better when I'm not in string freeze mode again.  It needs
	  to be made better on the chooser as well.

Mon Jul 02 14:11:38 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/choose.c, daemon/gdm.c: do not count chooser as pending
	  indirect displays, they are not.  Only count them when the host has
	  been chosen, so this allows as many choosers as login screens.
	  When a new host is chosen and the limit has been reached, whack the
	  oldest pending indirect display.  Makes choosers much easier to
	  manage and use, and makes more sense.

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: set the background color if any background is set

Mon Jul 02 12:42:58 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: remove sources for the watches during xdmcp close

	* configure.in: raise version to 2.2.3

Sun Jul 01 21:48:30 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: add ja.po and zh_TW.Big5 as those work again
	  apparently

Sun Jul 01 15:08:51 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/choose.[ch]: use correct prototypes and stop
	  casting watch functions

Sun Jul 01 05:25:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: Another example of why we want compile time
	  typesafety.  The GIOFunc was casted in the watch adding since
	  it had a different prototype, and I was getting somewhat random
	  return values.  Which meant that the chooser would stop working
	  at points completely.  Eeeek!  So change to correct prototype
	  to make the chooser happy.

Sun Jul 01 04:50:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: scan the hosts 3 times in 2 second intervals
	  like xdm chooser (and don't scan already found hosts) also
	  when we get explicit localhost reply get the local hostname
	  so that we get only entry for the local host.

Sun Jul 01 03:53:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: actually get the configurator key, allows
	  configuration yet again from the greeter.

Fri Jun 29 19:10:48 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: Apply patch from Nalin Dahyabhai
	  <nalin@redhat.com> to first zero out the reply array

Fri Jun 29 02:32:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: fixes and cleanups to the error display code.

	* daemon/server.c: remove O_APPEND from log file openning since it
	  was being overridden by O_TRUNC anyway.  On crash see if the logfile
	  looks like display being busy.  If it does, tell the user so.  This
	  prevents this case from looking like crashes, and is more
	  informative.  Perhaps we should try starting on the first free
	  display.  That would be good to investigate in the future.

Fri Jun 29 01:22:20 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in:  Apply cleanup patch from drscott12@hotmail.com
	  (Dean Scott)

Thu Jun 28 18:48:56 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade), gui/gdmchooser.c:
	  Add two keys Broadcast and Hosts to the chooser configuration
	  to allow more fine grained control as to what appears in the
	  chooser.  And to allow listing of hosts not reachable by
	  broadcast.

	* doc/C/gdm.sgml: add docs for the above two keys

	* daemon/choose.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c:
	  Fix a race with the daemon not getting the chooser response in
	  time.  Also move the chooser page from system setup to expert

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: get all local interface addresses and use those
	  for forward query in case we see only loopback as our address.
	  This is useful if you do an indirect query to the local host
	  and choose a remote server.  xdm screws this case up, so we have
	  one up on xdm here.

	* daemon/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdmchooser.c, daemon/gdmwm.c:  Fix some
	  gdmwm issues.  In the browser window allow Ctrl-F after selecting
	  a face to finger that user and display the result, useful to check
	  if you have new mail or whatnot.  Also strip excluded users before
	  checking to allow spaces in the Exclude list.

2001-06-28  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: Added nn_NO.
	
Thu Jun 28 13:44:40 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in, config/Xsession.in: use /bin/sh and not /bin/bash

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: fix crash when reading long session files

	* daemon/slave.c: s/editing/editing/

Tue Jun 26 23:00:04 2001  Trevor Curtis <trevor.curtis@home.com>

	* docs/gdmconfig/C: added sections for Miscellaneous, and Login 
	  Sessions. Updated XServer-Setup section. 
	* docs/gdmconfig/C/figures/*: updated GDM_xserv_setup.png, and 
	  GDM_login_sessions.png. Added GDM_expert_misc.png

Mon Jun 25 02:43:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: remove the POTFILES sed rule as that makes autogen.sh
	  whack out

Mon Jun 25 01:10:04 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c, daemon/slave.c: Get a picture from the config
	  file.  when the picture is in a known pixmap directory, don't
	  check it since it's a system file.  Makes it possible to select
	  larger system files which will be then scaled down, but the user
	  can't point it to a malicious picture.

Sun Jun 24 23:53:34 EDT 2001 Trevor Curtis <trevor.curtis@home.com>

	* edited gdmconfig.sgml to make editing it a little easier.

Sun Jun 24 14:55:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):  Add daemon/AlwaysRestartServer option
	  so that the slave can just kill and restart the server instead
	  of re-initing it.

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: update for all the new options

Sun Jun 24 14:07:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: when ping times out, do proper session stopping
	  first rather then just a straight kill

Sun Jun 24 13:45:59 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade), gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add suspend command
	  support although it is off by default (empty command)  Also do
	  checks for commands and don't show their respective menu items
	  if the commands are not present or empty

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade),
	  gui/gdmlogin.c:  Apply and massage a patch from Michel Dagenais
	  <michel.dagenais@polymtl.ca> to add optional support
	  for remote auto (timed) login, and also to use enriched strings
	  for the timed and automatic login names.  This is to make the
	  life of sysadmins easier if they're managing a large set of
	  x terminals.

Sat Jun 23 03:17:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in, Makefile.am: some pam related fixage

Fri Jun 22 21:02:21 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: actually implement ScanTime

Fri Jun 22 19:13:05 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: fix indirect wait entry, add entries for the
	  showing of different built in sessions (failsafes, chooser)

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): add toggling of builtin sessions
	  (failsafes, chooser)

Fri Jun 22 18:53:14 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: fix up the forward query sending/handling, fix
	  some wrong freeing too, and fix the hosts_ctl warning by including
	  a prototype.  We finally have chooser stuff all working! Yay!

	* daemon/xdmcp.c, gui/gdmchooser.c: we want to be very careful in
	  what types we pass xdmcp functions, the header does not include
	  arguments in the prototypes, so usage is snarfed from xdm

Fri Jun 22 15:50:00 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmwm.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c: unify the
	  xinerama stuff in gdmwm

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: fix warning

Fri Jun 22 15:26:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/Makefile.am, daemon/choose.[ch], daemon/xdmcp.c,
	  daemon/gdm.h, daemon/display.c:  Rework of how choosing works,
	  should theoretically all work and be complete, but it doesn't work
	  currently

2001-06-20  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Added here too.
	* config/locale.alias: Added entry for nynorsk.
	
Sat Jun 16 05:24:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: fix warning

Sat Jun 16 04:43:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/choose.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/gdm.h:
	  Make choosing somewhat work.  Now always works if local host is
	  chosen, but otherwise seems to have issues.

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: do version checking when under gdm, and display a
	  dialog after max indirect wait time

Fri Jun 15 17:27:38 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c: minor cleanups and i18n fixes 

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/choose.c: a
	  bunch of xdmcp related fixes, and actually run the greeter on
	  indirect queries, though it still doesn't actually choose the host,
	  but oh well.

	* daemon/slave.c: fix GETFD argument when doing SETFD on the pipe

Wed Jun 13 22:22:55 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: on xterm failsafe session, instead of doing
	  XSetInputFocus, just warp the pointer to the first window's
	  center.  That works just as well and allows pointer root focus
	  to still work

Tue Jun 12 19:26:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: when running scripts always set the right
	  USER/LOGNAME etc...  Thanks to Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano
	  <nando@ccrma.stanford.edu> for pointing this out.

Tue Jun 12 18:14:32 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:  do version checking
	  and allow restarting gdm if possible, or at least rebooting and
	  telling the user what is happening

Sun Jun 10 17:13:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: fix CONSOLE_HELPER test

	* gui/gdmwm.c: follow the motif deco hint a bit, and do better job of
	  placement, and also do a hack to correctly place gkrellm.

Wed Jun 06 16:51:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing, daemon/gdm.c: try gdialog if we can't find
	  standard dialog, that might work as well.

Wed Jun 06 06:03:41 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am: add -f to mv

Wed Jun 06 00:59:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am: do the conditional chooser build
	  in a kosher way that actually works

Wed Jun 06 00:41:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am: when compiling without xdmcp
	  don't compile the chooser

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmchooser.c: Use gdmwm for window management
	  and query xinerama as well.  Also do manage on doubleclick

	* daemon/choose.c, daemon/xdmcp.c: Some obvious fixes, note that
	  indirect lookup will NOT return an expired Indirect thingie. 
	  Still need to figure out where does the chooser plug in.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmchooser.c: run gdmwm only when not debugging

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.c, daemon/errorgui.[ch],
	  daemon/Makefile.am:  Deal with the hanging bugs by doing an exec
	  before running the gtk gui.  Also make the gui use GNOME to be
	  prettier.  I'm less and less sure I like this hack and it might
	  move into a separate binary, though this way it is faster as
	  gdm is already paged in.  This also fixes some i18n problems
	  with the error dialog.

Tue Jun 05 21:27:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: fix hanging related to centering of dialogs.

Mon Jun 04 20:45:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, gdmconfig-security(.in), gdm.spec.in:
	  cleaned up the pam stuff ala gnome-utils

	* configure.in, accconfig.h, daemon/xdmcp.[ch], daemon/gdm.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): Detect the xdmcp libs and compile
	  without xdmcp support if not found and allow selecting this
	  option ala the xinerama one.  The configurator will disable
	  the xdmcp options if they aren't compiled in

	* daemon/gdm.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): Apparently
	  5 seconds is useful for timed login so lower the minimum from 10
	  to 5

Sun Jun 03 04:55:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h: remove unused opcode (GDM_STOP)

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: On GDM_QUIT the login will make
	  sure to quickly quit and in the slave we no longer kill it to
	  avoid a possible race, also try to avoid other races todo with
	  killing things.  Also fclose the greeter channel to avoid a leak.

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c: get the size of the screen from
	  xinerama and center error dialog stuff.

Sat Jun 02 03:41:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.2.1

Sat Jun 02 02:14:37 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h: use 64 for the code for X failing and not 1 

Sat Jun 02 01:58:15 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: bump version

	* auth.c, xdmcp.c, cookie.c: fix clobering of cookies with zeros, only
	  reget hostname on local displays, correctly setup authentication for
	  local xdmcp case. reset umask to sane gdm value after setting the
	  use auth

	* gdm.c: cleanup, possible fd leak if there was a stale pid file

	* server.c: handle memory errors in cookie setup

	* slave.c: from xdm stole the idea of a bogus first client which
	  apparently fixes some things.  Also actually close initial display
	  on xdmcp session end.  Also make sure language is at least "C" if
	  we can't find any other language

	* slave.c: SECURITY! when re-initializing the display for another go,
	  first bake new cookies

Fri Jun 01 17:51:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: when sending GDM_QUIT to the greeter, first make
	  sure greet is FALSE to avoid a race, this fixes the bugs where
	  people couldn't log in.  Also added a bit of debugging.  Also fixed
	  a problem where on a failed execution of a script one would get two
	  slaves.

2001-05-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h: add config keys for show/disable the sessions that 
	are added in addition to those in /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions, so that
	admins can fully control the session list

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add abovementioned config keys

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_login_parse_config): honor these settings
	
Thu May 31 03:17:32 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: set euid/egid to 0 before verify check

	* daemon/slave.c: set euid/egid to 0 at a bunch of places just to
	  make sure that's how they're set.  When children want to exit they
	  shouldn't use the slave_exit function as that's dangerous to the
	  slave's health.  Instead use a new function for this which
	  doesn't do slave specific cleanup.  Also fix segfaults on startup.

	* daemon/verify-pam.c: the credential setting is supposed to be done
	  after openning a session.  Closing of a session is done silently as
	  well, just for good measure as wel don't have anything to talk to
	  anymore anyway

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/server.c: when re-initing ignore X errors
	  and do not reopen the display.  When openning the display the first
	  time, don't try so hard for a local display and instead wipe slave
	  and try again.

Wed May 30 21:43:21 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: make iconify button nicer by making it smaller and
	  adding more border around it

Wed May 30 19:17:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmphotosetup.c: fix permission setting, and open the source
	  before dest.  Though a bit pointless since jrb is apparently
	  rewriting the whole bit :)

Wed May 30 16:19:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):
	  Add a PingInterval xdmcp thingie which is a combination of
	  the xdm PingInterval and PingTimeout.

2001-05-30  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): remove ja.po and zh_TW.Big5.po. 
	ja.po contains invalid euc-jp. zh_TW.Big5.po causes gettext 
	to get upset but iconv likes it OK, so I don't know.

Wed May 30 04:00:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: Save session in
	  the gdm options file if requested from the chooser.  This is done
	  since it's no longer saved in gsm which is the sane behaviour
	  actually.

Wed May 30 02:13:53 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: run gnome-session with --failsafe in failsafe
	  gnome mode

Tue May 29 15:47:16 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/locale.alias: Add british/american english language choices

	* gui/gdmlanguages.c: Add the POSIX/C locale if it doesn't exist

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Make the minimize button like an actual minimize
	  button instead of an arrow.  It's a black line in the bottom of the
	  button.  Also turned on the relief again as it looks better like
	  that now I think.

Tue May 29 00:38:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: ignore .rpmorig files as well,
	  and some cosmetic code changes

Mon May 28 02:24:43 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Fixed a stupid mistake cased by a missed warning,
	  not really that crucial since the default config has no failsafe
	  X servers, because AFAIK, no such beast exists yet

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/misc.[ch], daemon/slave.c:  In case the
	  language doesn't have '_' as the third character it's a communist
	  and must be executed.  Or perhaps we should just read the alias
	  file and translate it.  This should really only happen if sysadmin
	  and screwed up or the user has a very old setting from pre 2.2 days

Sun May 27 23:39:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/PostSession, config/PreSession: Don't change utmp since
	  there is no "terminal", debian bug #90981

Thu May 24 16:05:32 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.2

Thu May 24 15:32:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, gdm-restart.in, Makefile.am: a script to restart
	  the gdm daemon, in sbin for root pleasure only

	* gdm.spec.in: redo the file list to be hopefully sane

	* daemon/gdm.c: actually read in GdmConfigurator

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: show help from the help button

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmwm.[ch]: add some short-circuit functions
	  for window moving, bypassing the window management foo.  This makes
	  quiver nice again.

Thu May 24 13:22:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: add ms (Bahasa Melayu), the official Microsoft
	  locale, for translations by Khairulanuar Abd Majid <khai@jaring.my>

Thu May 24 12:55:05 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, docs/Makefile.am, omf-install/Makefile.am,
	  docs/sgmldocs.make, docs/gdmconfig/C/Makefile.am, Makefile.am:
	  Set up the documentation/omf build stuff.

	* docs/gdmconfig/C/gdmconfig.sgml: fix version to say 2.2.2 and this
	  is part of the GDM package not the Gnome-Core package :)

Wed May 23 23:31:00 2001  Trevor Curtis <trevor.curtis@home.com>
	
	* docs/gdmconfig/C/gdmconfig.sgml: Added the expert and system
	  descriptions.

	* docs/gdmconfig/C/figures: Was created to put the screenshots
	  in for the gdmconfig doc.

	* docs/gdmconfig/C/figures/*: added the following png's; 
	  GDM_auto_login.png, GDM_background.png, GDM_chooser.png,
	  GDM_enviro.png, GDM_face_brow.png,  GDM_full.png, 
	  GDM_login_appear.png, GDM_login_behav.png, GDM_login_sessions.png,
	  GDM_menubar.png, GDM_misc.png, GDM_paths.png, GDM_security.png, 
	  GDM_xdmcp.png, GDM_xserv_setup.png

Mon May 21 11:31:35 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/Makefile.am: Eeek, we were
	  using the gnome_datadir_file function so when gdm was installed in
	  a different prefix we didn't do too well.  Make a define for our
	  own installation and first look there.

Sun May 20 19:32:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.c, gui/gdmphotosetup.c: Fix some
	  spelling errors and gramatical weirdness as pointed out by
	  Christian Rose <menthos@menthos.com>

Fri May 18 04:17:00 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, docs/C/gdm.sgml,
	  config/gdm.conf.in, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):  Add a config
	  option for a failsafe X server which is empty by default

Fri May 18 00:16:58 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Makefile.am: don't overwrite gnomerc on install, that's bad
	  juju

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: update for the XKeepsCrashing stuff

Thu May 17 15:44:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Makefile.am: install factory settings, and for most settings
	  files, overwrite the current and save the current in .orig files.
	  this way changes will propagate.  Don't do this for gdm.conf
	  however, this is the most likely to be modified by the user.

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmphotosetip.desktop.in, gui/gdmphotosetup.c:
	  a small proggie to setup the face for a user.  Should at some point
	  become a capplet and include all the gdm user settings

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade): fix some segfaults, include a factory
	  settings reverting, and move the exclude users to the face
	  browser as that's where it belongs

Thu May 17 03:38:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix segfault in the login entry checking code 

Thu May 17 02:52:38 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, confgiure.in, debian/Default.debian,
	  config/Makefile.am:  Don't put the debian stuff into the tarball,
	  and remove it from the config, this is here for people wanting to
	  live off the bleeding edge of 2.0-beta4 and run a stable gdm.
	  Hopefully the gdm 2.2.x packages will show up in mainstream debian
	  soon (they don't seem to be there now).  Plus some make distcheck
	  fixes

Thu May 17 01:27:15 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/XKeepsCrashing, config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.[ch],
	  daemon/server.c, config/Makefile.am, daemon/slave.c: Added a script
	  to run when X keeps crashing, this will run an X configuration
	  tool (after asking for root password of course), only works
	  on systems with /usr/bin/open (linux only I suppose) and XFree86
	  for now.

	* gui/Makefile,am:  fix make dist issues

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): fix some issues, move debugging into it's
	  own page and add the keeps crashing options from above

Wed May 16 15:10:07 2001  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (update_clock): Have clock update only once a
	minute.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (gdm_screen_init): add missing declaration to
	make it compile.

Tue May 15 17:36:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Apply patch from Remi@Cohen-Scali.com (Rémi
	  Cohen-Scali) to fix #54723.  The sessions were not strduped when
	  put into the global list.  Bad bad gdm :)

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c:  when xdmcp is disabled and no
	  servers exist and we can find /usr/bin/X11/X, this would mean that
	  the user is an idiot and deleted all servers.  So add one for him
	  and give him a warning before letting him log in and fix things.
	  also graphically complain about not being able to start the
	  greeter.

	* daemon/gdm.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: Don't abort on recoverable errors
	  that wouldn't be security problems.  Also allow things to be run
	  without a config file, using the defaults

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c: fix the default for the welcome
	  string, overcoming gnome-config idiocy

	* gui/gdmconfig.c:  Warn user if he removed all servers.

Tue May 15 15:28:57 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/slave.c: Don't abort when a binary isn't
	  found, instead try running the default binary and always give
	  graphical errors.  Since we allow graphical hosification, we need
	  to allow graphical unhosification as well, and thus gdm must be
	  able to run in some default mode under adverse conditions.  It is
	  still possible to utterly hose the system, but less so now.

	* gui/gdmconfig.c:  Interactively check commands, directories and
	  files for existence and display them in red if they don't.  This
	  way the user has immediate feedback that he is going to hose stuff
	  without having to actually try the hosing.

	* configure.in:  Fix the standard path defines

Tue May 15 02:39:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmwm.c: fix focusing windows on enter notify 

Tue May 15 02:14:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:  gdmlogin cannot
	  fetch user pictures.  SO there is now an interface so that the
	  slave can check/fetch the pictures for gdmlogin.  Unfortunately
	  imlib is braindead so the way we pass the pictures is to write them
	  to a temp file.  So this is even less friendly on large systems.
	  Paranoia is high however so there should not be a way to exploit
	  it.  Unless you find a pic that kills imlib in which case you can
	  run a dos, so this isn't an option for all systems anyway.

Mon May 14 23:54:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Browser fixes.  Do smarter sizing of the browser
	  window, align logo to the right to make it look nicer, fix warning
	  when logo image missing, exclude root from browser if he wouldn't
	  be allowed in anyway, fix reading of users, rewind the pw entry

	* config/gdm.conf.in: change default locale from english to en_US,
	  since not everything can properly dealias these things
	  unfortunately

Mon May 14 22:42:51 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c:  setup the environment better for the greeter
	  and setup the actual HOME if it exists etc... This makes it nicer
	  for BackgroundProgram's.  so if say the user wants to run a
	  gnome program (which require a writable home dir) he can just
	  create /home/gdm (or whatever it's in /etc/passwd)

Mon May 14 22:20:09 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/Makefile.am: install the index.html file correctly on make
	  install.  For those weirdos like me that run out of CVS

Mon May 14 21:52:53 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml:  Add proper copyrights/authors for me and Tim Jensen
	  and update the configuration section with all the new keys.

	* config/gdm.conf.in:  Run configurator with --disable-sound and
	  --disable-crash-dialog

Mon May 14 20:53:16 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade), gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add a
	  boolean flag for both timed and automatic login.  This makes
	  configuring it nicer and easier to understand

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add a clock, perhaps there should be a config
	  option about this

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmlanguages.[ch], gui/Makefile.am:  Add a
	  somewhat primitive (unfinished) framework for translating language
	  names.  Unfortunately names are hardcoded, though available
	  languages are still read from locale.alias.

Mon May 14 03:16:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: in the error dialog thing do the button click
	  mapping as well

Mon May 14 02:15:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: define RUNNING_UNDER_GDM for gdmlogin and gdmconfig

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c:  When RUNNING_UNDER_GDM is defined
	  we treat button click 3 like 1 since the user could be left
	  handed but has not yet logged in.

Mon May 14 00:55:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmwm.[ch], gui/gdmlogin.c: Clean up stuff,
	  move the WM stuff into a separate file, make it run on a separate
	  X connection, add a cool shadow to windows, do more correct window
	  management, and all windows are managed now.

Sun May 13 13:09:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Simplify filters and only use the Substructure
	  mask thing.  Handle border correctly (to make xclock look cool)

	* daemon/server.c:  Eeek, HUP and TERM should have been DFL and not
	  IGN though the X server didn't seem to mind.  Also set TTIN and
	  TTOU to IGN since that's what happens when I startx apparently,
	  I think this may be responsible for the X server dying on me
	  on unsuspend

Sun May 13 04:40:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Add a tooltip to the iconify arrow

Sun May 13 04:36:14 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdmlogin.c: recenter windows when they resize, add a single
	  black line decoration to make it easy to distinguish windows
	  layered on top of each other (such as in the configurator)

Sun May 13 00:59:48 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* AUTHORS, NEWS, README: updated

	* Makefile.am, RELEASENOTES: removed, no longer needed and horribly
	  useless and confusing to users

Sat May 12 23:44:38 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: add configuration summary, fix libwrap detection
	  and add configuration options to enable/disable xinerama
	  tcpwrappers and choose the authentication scheme

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c:  don't ask for
	  passwords on passwordless logins, fix a leak, and make crypt
	  support actually compile.  Also check password before testing if
	  the account is disabled.

	* daemon/slave.c:  Focus first X window with res_name "xterm" when
	  running the failsafe xterm session

Sat May 12 19:32:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: when we don't find the wrappers library don't add
	  it to LIBS

Sat May 12 19:28:30 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c: Add .dpkg-old to the list of
	  extensions to ignore

Sat May 12 16:47:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Xsession: check for freetemp existing

Sat May 12 15:23:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: properly check for NULLs on cursess and curlang.
	  Never, NEVER make the default session the last session, the
	  entire point of that would not work, there is no Last session when
	  you use the default (that's the whole idea:).  Be more strict on the
	  language stuff as well, avoiding possible cases of crashing and
	  warnings.

Thu May 10 00:29:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): Add setting
	  (which is default) to only set background color on remote logins.

	* gdm/gdmlogin.c:  Icon has a tooltip now, and a bunch of the menu
	  items as well

	* config/gdm.conf.in, config/gdm.h, gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade),
	  gui/gdmlogin.c:  Allow color to "seep through" transparent images
	  and thus the color selector is on even for images.  Add a setting
	  for only allowing color on remote logins.  This is useful to avoid
	  net traffic.

Wed May 09 18:19:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Center all mapped windows, also disallow
	  negative positions in centered windows.  Also clip size of
	  windows to the screen size.

	* daemon/gdm.h, acconfig.h, configure.in:  Make sure proper defaults 
	  are read in.  That is, if gdm.conf is missing the result should be
	  same as the supplied gdm.conf.  Also make ConfigAvailable=true the
	  default.  It will always query for root password so it's safe.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c: When resetting after
	  config don't quiver.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: properly translate failsafes

	* daemon/slave.c:  properly test for existence/executability of
	  just the path not arguments, and don't test for read on session
	  executions.

	* daemon/server.c:  Properly XSync before popping error handler

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c:  Check for
	  xinerama and start error dialogs and xterm failsafe at the
	  correct offset.

	* daemon/slave.c: Properly handle focus on the error dialog

Tue May 08 16:38:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Actually make the xinerama scaling thing work.
	  Also limit the dragging to within xinerama screens and avoid
	  dead space.  Allow jumping in between xinerama screens when
	  dragging as well.

Mon May 07 17:12:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/icon-entry-hack.c: update from gnome-core to fix selection
	  dialog issues

Sun May 06 22:27:31 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: support xinerama in background scaling and scale
	  image onto each screen rather then onto the entire screen

Sun May 06 16:31:07 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Failsafe*, config/Makefile.am, configure.in, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  daemon/gdm.h: Use our built in Failsafe thingies since they're more
	  safe from hosage.  Also be nicer in translating them and add some
	  tooltippage.

	* config/Xsession, config/Gnome.in:  Load in the xresources and
	  modmap and such magic.  Make it work on both rh6 and rh7 and
	  hopefully others.

	* daemon/slave.c:  Add more errors and pass some nice parameters
	  to the failsafe thingies.

Sun May 06 05:36:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: use the "Default" script if found as default

	* config/Gnome.in:  Read in ~/.Xresources, we need more magic
	  in this script however.

Fri May 04 18:10:08 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.1

Thu May 03 18:28:04 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmchooser.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c,
	  gui/misc.[ch]:  Add a misc functions file and add
	  strcasecmp_no_locale and use it.  Without this we fail in all kinds
	  of wird locale (like iso -9)

Thu May 03 17:13:23 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmchooser.c:  Use DOING_GDM_DEVELOPMENT env
	  var (scrap the old GDMCONFIG one for gdmconfig) and add actual
	  useful messages when glade stuff fails (as it does in ximian
	  packages now, but that makes a nice core file in those which sucks)

Thu May 03 13:22:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmconfig.desktop(.in), po/POTFILES.in,
	  po/*.po, configure.in, Makefile.am:  Add the usage of
	  xml-i18n-tools for the desktop file

Wed May 02 18:08:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: fix limits on the spinbuttons

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Fix default linking, provide uniqueness checking
	  fix naming races, and generally make the whole session editor
	  actually work right.

Wed May 02 03:15:15 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: fix running of gdmconfig by setuid/gid to 0
	  and give an error dialog box if the configurator is not found

Wed May 02 01:44:36 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in, config/Xsession: don't use bash -login, because we
	  have already ran a login shell which was the users login shell

	* config/gnomerc.in, daemon/slave.c: use exec to avoid running 2
	  unneeded shells.  Now if you log in there is no extra shell process
	  running.  This saves quite a bit of ram in fact since things like
	  bash eat up quite a bit of ram, and if the user doesn't use any
	  shells, none of it is shared.

	* daemon/slave.c:  Fix a doh! error in the last commit where I got
	  confused about which sessions I was talking about (gsm vs. gdm),
	  also a little bit of cleanup

Tue May 01 16:28:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmconfig.c,
	  gui/gdmlogin.c:  Make it possible to log in even if the sessions
	  directory is missing or empty.  Of course if that happens the
	  user gets a "you're an idiot and your setup's b0rk" warning dialog
	  (well not in those exact words)

Tue May 01 14:41:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: instead of a define, read a
	  DOING_GDMCONFIG_DEVELOPMENT env var.

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: ignore sessions ending in .deleted
	  and .desc

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Session names ARE case sensitive
	  so remove all this case insensitivity crack that could seriously mess
	  things up.  The only case insensitive thing is that the default
	  link can be case insensitive, the actual files are sensitive.

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade): fix a bunch of stuff with respect to
	  the Session directory editing.  Not all tested though, so still
	  use at your own risk.  Though it theoretically has less problems
	  now.  Also cleaned up stuff a tiny bit.  This file could use a run
	  through indent.

Mon Apr 30 17:27:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix a couple of possible crashes with invalid images
	  being set.  Limit the logo size by just cropping the widget, that
	  way user will still be able to log in if he screws up the config

	* configure.in, config/gdm.conf.in:  Use the sbin path if using
	  console helper for the Configurator setting, else it won't work
	  right

Mon Apr 30 16:48:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm/gdm.[ch], gdm/verify-(pam|crypt|shadow).c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):  Add an option to toggle logging in
	  of root remotely.  So one can allow local root login but disallow
	  remote root logins.

	* daemon/slave.c:  add nicer error messages to all the exec failures

Mon Apr 30 02:34:37 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in, deamon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade):  Split up the max sizes into normal
	  and another one for session files for which the limit is much
	  higher.  This is because session files are never read into memory,
	  but rather just scanned.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c:  When no session is set browse
	  through a list of possibles in order to find a good session.

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/Makefile.am:  Link the slave to gtk libs,
	  and in case the session script doesn't exist isn't executable
	  or isn't readable, display an error instead of the session.

Sun Apr 29 23:54:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in, config/gnomerc, config/Makefile.am:  Revert stupid
	  changes, now we rely on a new enough gnome-core where gsm
	  understands GDM_GNOME_SESSION (in a similar way to GDM_LANG)

	* daemon/verify-*.c:  Eeeek Forgot to use the GDM_LOGIN prompter
	  opcode and that made the greeter very unhappy

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: Ignore .orig files as well when
	  looking at the Sessions dir

Sun Apr 29 22:46:12 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add running of
	  the configurator from the slave rather then the login which
	  doesn't work.  There is a special session setup for this so that
	  the user gets prompted for the root password first.

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/server.c:
	  Only do the timed logins on the first local display just like
	  autologin.  We don't want to do simultaneous logins of the same
	  user on different screens really, that's usually bad.

	* daemon/gdm.c: Increase general paranoia and don't trust the greeter
	  and only allow reboots/config/halts when they are actually allowed
	  in the config file and only for local.

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade, gui/gdmconfig.c:  Add a bunch of tooltips,
	  and add the configuration stuff for the timed logins

Sun Apr 29 18:06:25 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.[ch],
	  daemon/verify.h, daemon/verify-(pam|crypt|shadow).c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in:  Create the concept of interruptions where the
	  greeter can interrupt a query to have the daemon do something.
	  and use it to do timeout logins, such as would be useful for
	  say a kiosk operation.  Only on local displays of course.
	  Originally based on the patch from Jim Bray.

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade:  Raise the maximum allowable max user file
	  size to 2^18 from 2^16

Sun Apr 29 21:40:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade: Add the "run configurator"
	  options and gdmconfig path to gdmconfig itself. (hmmm).
	
	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade: Add a new notebook tab to
	  the expert panel that allows configuration of the 'Sessions'
	  directory; adding, editing, deleting & setting a new default are
	  currently supported.

Sun Apr 29 02:00:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Gnome.in, config/Makefile.am:  Always install gnomerc
	  and Gnome even if they already exist, this is because we may
	  want to change these and want these changes to propagate.  Not
	  a perfect solution since it's not clear which config files are
	  editable without the install mucking them up, but oh well.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.(glade|c):  Parse the session and session options
	  file and pass the sessions to the greeter if Gnome Chooser session
	  is selected.  The chooser then allows the picking of one specific
	  gsm session or the creation of a new one.  We set an env var
	  GDM_GNOME_SESSION with the session name in it.

	* daemon/gdm.c:  doh!  on automatic login actually use the saved
	  language and session

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: the execution of background prog and config now
	  closes all descriptors and opens /dev/null for stdin/out/err.  Also
	  the config program is killed on exit just like the background prog
	  and we don't allow starting multiple config programs.

Sat Apr 28 16:01:48 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Remove the overlay window crack and write a simple
	  windowmanager.  Yeah I feared this would happen one day.  Focus
	  now works properly finally, focus shows and GTK+ seems happy.
	  This also makes it possible to have the background clients have
	  sane focus management (with sloppy focus).  Though no frames,
	  window movement, nor icons.  (the login window still manages
	  it's frame, movement and icon itself)

	* config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.glade:  Add a setting for disabling the titlebar,
	  apparently some people hate it and I'd rather this be done by
	  configuration then patches.  Then the user can easily re-enable it.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: a little bit of work on the session chooser dialog
	  still doesn't actually do anything

Sat Apr 28 17:50:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.h, config/gdm.conf.in: Add the option
	  (and relevant paths in the config) to run gdmconfig from the system
	  menu in gdmlogin. Disabled by default for obvious reasons. This
	  closes bug #53783.

Fri Apr 27 16:41:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, daemon/gdm.h, daemon/slave.c, config/Gnome.in: 
	  Start on gsm session support.  Still doesn't work.  Also make gdm
	  session strings translatable.  At least some of the standard ones,
	  not perfect but oh well, who cares.

Tue Apr 24 18:45:55 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/PostSession, config/PreSession, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Apply
	  small bits of the ximian patches.  Pre/PostSession scripts only
	  run sessreg if it exists.  and gdmlogin selects the Gnome session
	  if no "default" exists.

Tue Apr 24 15:04:56 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: set the menu separators to insensitive to make
	  keyboard navigation nicer

Mon Apr 23 22:34:24 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: always draw the focus correctly and hardset the
	  gtk focus flag.  Hmm, I'm beginning not to like all this focus
	  voodoo that gdmlogin does.

Mon Apr 23 22:04:24 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, acconfig.h, daemon/auth.c, daemon/misc.[ch],
	  daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify.h,
	  daemon/verify-(pam|crypt|shadow).h:  Fixup environment issues.
	  Clear the environment before running a session and before launching
	  the greeter (taking care to save the localisation vars).  Also
	  don't set user env on the slave and leave it, if we set it it's
	  only temporary.  Also fix one possible crash by strduping the
	  pam env since that will go away and putenv doesn't strdup.

Mon Apr 23 20:16:07 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: when we find libwrap.a instead of specifying that
	  filename, use -lwrap which may be better on some systems

Mon Apr 23 20:08:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  if no LANG/LC_ALL is set, use the GdmDefaultLocale
	  setting as our locale.

Mon Apr 23 18:49:55 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  fix buffer overrun in making the enriched string

Sat Apr 21 11:46:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/icon-entry-hack.[ch]: update hack from panel

Thu Apr 19 17:32:36 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml:  Update the VerboseAuth and AllowRoot sections
	  to reflect what actually happens nowdays.

Thu Apr 19 13:18:59 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify-crypt.c, daemon/verify-shadow.c,
	  daemon/verify-pam.c:  Fix GdmAllowRoot (it only worked in verbose
	  mode), made the verbose mode selection useful without being
	  insecure, and in nonverbose mode you still get "Login incorrect"
	  message as those are safe.  In pam mode we now check for 
	  root as well.  We also now check for shell to be /bin/false as
	  a sign the user was disallowed from logging in.

Thu Apr 19 03:48:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: don't search for shells, that's wrong, if the
	  user doesn't have a shell set, we are supposed to use straight
	  /bin/sh.  On linux this makes no difference anyway since that was
	  bash.  Also detect /bin/false shells and have a better error
	  message in that case in the log file.  We should detect those
	  earlier I suppose.

Thu Apr 19 02:11:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Return to gid 0 after verify check, patch from
	  rmurray+gnome@cyberhqz.com (Ryan Murray)

	* daemon/auth.c: refetch the hostname each time the cookie is
	  generated to deal with changing hostnames again from Ryan

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: remove the display mutilating code for enriched
	  string, again from Ryan

	* daemon/server.c: Move logfile open after fork as it's only
	  really used by the X server process (And that's the purpose of it)
	  Again, from, you guessed it, Ryan

	* daemon/slave.c: set gid after uid to 0 so that it doesn't fail
	  (from Ryan again)

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: do a gtk_main_quit in the QUIT handler, hopefully
	  won't cause races, and this is actually by me

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: another one from ryan, set the password max entry
	  length to 128 to allow for MD5 password things

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: another one, this one to allow keyboard navigation
	  of the menus

	* daemon/slave.c: call initgroups to set up the groups correctly,
	  from ryan

	* daemon/slave.c: fixed problem of NULL lang/session returns, pointed
	  out by ryan

Wed Apr 18 22:32:53 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, debian/Makefile.am: fix make distcheck
	  wrt libintl and make sure we get the debian directory into the
	  tarball

Tue Apr 17 17:01:59 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.glade, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add option for not
	  scaling the background to fit, and tiling instead.  I think
	  I might just implement more like the original background
	  selection thingie for the desktop.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Apply a patch (and massage it a bit) from
	  rmurray+gnome@cyberhqz.com (Ryan Murray) to make the locale
	  menu just not display if the locale file is missing.

2001-04-17  Ian McKellar  <ian@eazel.com>

	* acinclude.m4:
	Removed this - it contained out of date gettext stuff that was 
	screwing up my build.

	* config/Default.debian:
	* config/Makefile.am:
	* configure.in:
	* debian/.cvsignore:
	* debian/README.Debian:
	* debian/changelog.in:
	* debian/changelog.old:
	* debian/control:
	* debian/copyright:
	* debian/dirs:
	* debian/docs:
	* debian/ex.doc-base.package:
	* debian/gdm.pod:
	* debian/gdmchooser.pod:
	* debian/gdmlogin.pod:
	* debian/init:
	* debian/postinst:
	* debian/postrm:
	* debian/rules:
	Added Debian build stuff and default config. It shouldn't break
	builds on other platforms, but it might.

Sun Apr 15 12:58:02 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: fix misspelling thanks to jrb

Fri Mar 30 18:17:00 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in: up version to 2.2.1, and check for GdkPixbuf

	* config/Default, config/gdm.conf.in, daemon/gdm.h, gui/Makefile.am,
	  gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade,
	  gui/gdmconfig.h, gui/gdmlogin.c:  Add background image/color
	  setting and remove that setup from the Default init.

	* gui/Makefile.am, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/icon-entry-hack.[ch]:
	  Put in the icon entry hack from the panel to make the icon
	  entry behave properly

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Make overlay window override redirect, don't
	  proxy keyboard events to entry when window is iconified, raise
	  window when moving, raise window on uniconify, set initial manual
	  position after realize to avoid manual position being an offscreen
	  one properly, only allow one query dialog to be up

Mon Mar 12 16:21:47 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.2.0

Mon Mar 12 16:08:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade:  Remove the scrolled window
	  and make the window initially not shown so that the size doesn't
	  flicker.  Also nuke the hardcoded width and height.  Still has
	  some issues with really large fonts, but works good enough for a
	  release now.  Also set the side help string again, and comment out
	  the DOING_DEVELOPMENT define :)

Mon Mar 12 23:20:15 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Use a notebook instead of doing the container
	  voodoo. This should sort out the widget packing.

Fri Mar 09 21:00:03 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: Be slightly nicer to people with fonts
	  that aren't pretty small.

2001-03-12  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.desktop: Added Swedish strings.

Sun Mar 11 20:23:55 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: follow the xinerama screen size/position for
	  the icon as well.

Sat Mar 10 19:36:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: remove the clear message before first prompt hack,
	  and make it, clear after first return hack.  Also add a hack to
	  accumulate pam messages rather then replacing them in between
	  queries.  This fixes the weird clearing bugs with respect to
	  say expiring passwords.  Also clear message on GDM_RESET

Thu Mar 08 21:00:03 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Change (lack of) help message.

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: Set the initial height to be more
	  representative of what it's like when the containers have been
	  packed. Also do a little bit of container voodoo so the main panels
	  are in a viewport, (makes gdmconfig more usable on small screens).

Thu Mar 08 00:37:12 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: Fixups, move the security dir as well and
	  hardwire the sysconfdir to /etc as that seems broke on my 6.2 box
	  otherwise

	* configure.in: raise version to 2.2.0, no there isn't a release yet,
	  this is just to start rumors of an upcoming one.  (Plus I wanted
	  to build myself an rpm for my own use, cuz I'm not 'l33t 'nuff
	  to build on my system from cvs directly)

Wed Mar 07 22:50:06 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: minor fixups from the merge

2001-03-07  Gregory Leblanc <gleblanc@cu-portland.edu>

	* gdm.spec.in: much better macros, and better portability.  Please
	read the %ChangeLog section in the spec file for details.

Mon Mar 05 18:17:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* AUTHORS, README, README.install:  Do a quick update as it's all
	  horribly out of date.

Mon Mar 05 23:41:40 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.[ch]: Fix bug that caused only values of 0 and 1 for
	  RelaxPerms to be used/written.

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: Change RelaxPerms toggle to 3 radio buttons,
	  and remove some old cruft.

Mon Mar 05 22:42:54 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/Makefile.am: Change shared directory for glade files
	  to allow centralized storage of all gdm .glade files.
	  Link gdmchooser against libglade.
	
	* gui/gdmconfig.c: Use new location for glade files.
	
	* gui/gdmchooser.c: Gladeify gdmchooser and give it a slightly
	  less sucky GUI.
	
	* gui/gdmchooser.glade, gui/gdmchooser-strings.c: Added GUI and
	  translatable strings for updated gdmchooser.
	  
	* gui/*.glade: Ensure WM_Class is set to be 'gdm' everywhere.
	
	* gdm.spec.in: Adjust paths for new glade file and location.

Sun Mar 04 16:28:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/filecheck.[ch]: fix an error message and make const correct

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: make the photo checking code saner, this assumes
	  we're root and can read anyone's files, really and this is bad,
	  oh well, it is sort of weird.  Also a bunch of cleanup and
	  constization.

	* gui/Makefile.am: don't link to filecheck anymore

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c: cleanup some code, make GDM_QUIT
	  work for doing cleanup.  Make it not actually quit but just
	  cleanup to prepare to be killed.

Sun Mar 04 12:27:50 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Added a note to the config file about running
	  X on a specific console.  Mostly for packagers, apparently the
	  debian packages were broken in this respect.

Sun Mar  4 16:13:55 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* docs/gdmconfig/*: Added initial directory structure/files for
	the gdmconfig user guide. Not installed yet.
	
	* docs/gdmconfig/C/gdmconfig.sgml: Initial gdmconfig user guide
	content from Trevor Curtis <trevor.curtis@home.com>.

Wed Feb 28 19:23:42 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmchooser.c:  Apply patch from "Matthias Clasen"
	  <Matthias.Clasen@poet.de>, to fix issues with xdm.

Web Feb 28 18:47:14 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gdmconfig-pam, gdmconfig-security: New files to support
	privileged non-root users running gdmconfig.
	
	* Makefile.am, configure.in, gdm.spec.in: Add option to configure
	to --enable-console-helper for gdmconfig.

Tue Feb 27 16:44:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: apply patch from Vlad Harchev <hvv@hippo.ru>
	  to not force the adobe helvetica font and to exclude postgres and
	  pvm users by default

Tue Feb 27 13:27:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade:
	Fix version number and add bugzilla URL to about box.

2001-02-27  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gdmconfig/Makefile.am: removed DLOCALEDIR.
	* gdmconfig/gdmconfig.c/h: include config.h in c file, not h.
	i18n fixes, gui now translated.

Tue Feb 27 00:25:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.99

Tue Feb 27 00:25:09 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/xdmcp.c:  Fixed xdmcp closing routine, and
	  close the xdmcp fd before restarting after a HUP so that xdmcp
	  doesn't fail.  If we fail when initing xdmcp don't die, but just
	  disable xdmcp and continue after screaming stuff into syslog.

Wed Feb 21 01:46:34 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, config/Default: Setup cursor in gdmlogin

Tue Feb 20 13:57:18 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/Default: Idea from peter winnberg <peter@rsub.com>, to set
	  the cursor to left_ptr to be nicer

Mon Feb 19 09:01:56 2001  Yukihiro Nakai <nakai@gnome.gr.jp>

	* gui/gdmconfig.desktop: Add Japanese translation.

Mon Feb 19 21:37:07 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Patch from Tim Jansen <tim@tjansen.de>

	* docs/C/gdm.sgml:  fixed docs in terms of true/false vs. 1/0 and
	  add new values

	 * gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmchooser.c:  change GdmDebug to gboolean
	   and add some checks for config values

2001-02-19  Christophe Merlet  <christophe@merlet.net>

	* gui/gdmconfig.desktop: Added French strings.

Mon Feb 19 03:42:01 2001  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c (create_handle): Minor UI cleanup to gdmlogin.

Sun Feb 18 15:05:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.glade: Improve clarity, and make 'automatic login'
	more noticeable.

Sun Feb 18 11:32:00 2001  Lee Mallabone <lee0@callnetuk.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): GUI fixes for Xserver clist.

Sat Feb 17 19:08:00 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): Patch from Lee to fix xdmcp options
	  sensitivity, plus make the clist title passive and set it to
	  browse selection mode.

Thu Feb 15 03:18:15 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.98.1

Thu Feb 15 03:18:12 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, config/Gnome.in, config/Failsafe.in,
	  config/gdm.conf.in, config/gnomerc.in:  Fix the autogeneration,
	  by including all the prefixes and by expanding the variables.
	  Idea stolen from GConf configure.in

Wed Feb 14 18:53:57 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, config/Makefile.am: Apply patch from peter@ximian.com
	  (Peter Teichman), to generate config files from .in files during
	  configure time, rather then install time

	* gdm.spec.in: update for the above

Tue Feb 13 18:27:03 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c: Apply fix from "Matthias Clasen"
	  <Matthias.Clasen@poet.de> to make xmdcp work for him.  Also
	  massaged that function a bit further.  But it doesn't solve
	  my problems.

Mon Feb 12 02:18:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: remove a duplicate bindtextdomain foo, and remove
	  the default dialog pos is center thing since we explicitly set
	  this anyway.

Sun Feb 11 16:23:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.98

Sat Feb 10 18:05:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|glade): new update version of the configurator
	  from Lee Mallabone <lee@fonicmonkey.net> which makes it simpler to
	  do stuff.

Tue Feb 06 21:33:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c, daemon/verify-pam.c: pam cleanup done when slave
	  exiting.

Sun Feb 04 16:23:30 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.*: Apply patch from Lee Mallabone <lee@fonicmonkey.net>
	  To add a development define for debugging, and change a bit of
	  the layout to be more consistent.

Sat Feb 03 19:42:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.c:  Fix corruption of GSLists on exit

Sat Feb 03 18:24:10 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xmdcp.c: apply some changes found in the gdm debian
	  paches, but they don't make any difference

Sat Feb 03 17:58:51 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  Patch from Tim Jansen <tim@tjansen.de> to fix
	  a buffer overflow with xinerama support

Sat Feb 03 15:39:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdm.spec.in: patch from Lee Mallabone <lee@fonicmonkey.net>, to
	  make gdmconfig actually work. (install the glade and desktop file)

Fri Feb 02 23:32:56 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.97.1

Fri Feb 02 20:03:49 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, config/Default.redhat, config/Failsafe.redhat,
	  config/Failsafe.in, config/Makefile.am, gdm.spec.in:  First
	  attempt at making an rpm.  Doesn't break the build, but I doubt
	  it works as I haven't tried it.  Will test on my laptop later.

Fri Feb 02 18:29:40 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: the xinerama support might badmach if run under
	  a non xinerama supporting xserver, so trap errors and just assume
	  one screen if we get errors.

Thu Feb 01 18:28:33 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.97

Thu Feb 01 18:26:17 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Add a hack so that if the Welcome string is
	  set to a default, use the gettext translation for added hack
	  value and more translations.

Thu Feb 01 17:58:30 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|glade): some glade fixes, and add a reset option
	  when applying

	* daemon/gdm.h: use true/false for booleans in defaults

Thu Feb 01 17:05:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Apply an port a patch from <tim.jansen@systembureau.com>,
	  further modified default config (config/gdm.conf.in) and the 
	  configuratior (gui/gdmconfig.c) to include the screen option

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, configure.in: added support for Xinerama, 
	  the new key greeter/XineramaScreen selects on which screen the 
	  greeter will be centered

Thu Feb 01 04:49:11 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in:  Add gdm to the list of default excludes

	* daemon/gdm.c:  take HUP signal, which will unmanage all displays and
	  then re-exec itself.  This is a poor-mans reset, not integrated
	  with the configurator yet.

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/xdmcp.c:  Remove all loop of death catches except for the
	  slave restart one.  Move the server loop of death to display.c
	  as it must run in the master process, and it can now catch all
	  the error conditions without races.  Move sleeping to slave.
	  Kill many race conditions, some of them quite evil.  Kill the
	  greeter segfault detection, loop of death in display.c is enough
	  here.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c:  If LANG is set, use that for a default language,
	  preferring the DefaultLocale setting and use that only as fallback.
	  Instead of setting LANG to the name of the language, set it to
	  the proper unaliased string since our alias file may be different
	  from the system one.   And add a way to sort of get from codes to
	  langauge names.  Remove tolower ugly hack.

2001-01-31  Gediminas Paulauskas <menesis@delfi.lt>

	* gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade: fix some mistakes in
	strings.
	* config/locale.alias: added lithuanian.

Tue Jan 30 20:19:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: Make quiver more visible and cooler looking (/me
	  thinks)

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Verbose Auth is on by default, since now it
	  doesn't reveal information,  Not sure if this option is useful
	  for anything really.  We want "Login Incorrect" messages all the
	  time.  May need some thought

	* daemon/verify-(crypt|shadow).c: Don't reveal what went wrong on
	  login, just say "Login incorrect"

Tue Jan 30 16:52:39 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Pfffffffffffffft!  Really apply the patch from ChiDeok Hwang
	  <hwang@mizi.co.kr>

	* daemon/slave.c, gui/gdm.c:  Some locale stuff fixes.  This still
	  feels really wrong as it mostly ignores the systemwide setting and
	  uses it's own default most of the time.  And that's bad.  Needs
	  some work.

Tue Jan 30 19:08:46 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c, gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade: configuration
	  key fixes

	* gui/Makefile.am: add desktop and glade to extradist

	* gui/gdmconfig.desktop: start gdmconfig not gdmlogin (doh!)

Tue Jan 30 15:16:40 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/server.c, daemon/xdmcp.c, daemon/slave.c,
	  gui/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig-strings.c, gui/gdmconfig.glade,
	  po/POTFILES.in: x18n fixes, add missing configuration options,
	  add warning dialog about when configuration will be applied,
	  fix up gboolean vs. int mess and it's related gnome_config stuff

Tue Jan 30 14:25:20 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	Patch from ChiDeok Hwang <hwang@mizi.co.kr>:

	* config/locale.alias:  remove one of the entries for french as
	  that turns out to be blank on non -1 locales

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/verify-pam.c, daemon/verify-crypt.c,
	  daemon/verify-shadow.c: i18n fixes

	* daemon/slave.c: made user to see last message when gdm sleeps.

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: empty other menu is ugly. So remove it when it is
	  empty.  gdm_slave_greeter_ctl(GDM_MSGERR, ...) was stalled waiting
	  output from gui.

	Patch from Lee Mallabone <lee@fonicmonkey.net>:

	* configure.in, gui/Makefile.am: make gdmconfig build and depend on
	  libglade

	* gui/gdmconfig.(c|h|desktop|glade): A working implementation of
	  the configuration.  Doesn't yet restart gdm and only works for root
	  (has no pam stuff), but much better then nothing.  Still missing
	  the new options for 2.1

2001-01-30  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added "nn" to ALL_LINGUAS.
	
Thu Jan 25 23:49:44 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Release 2.0.96

Thu Jan 25 23:04:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.[ch]: cleanup

	* daemon/gdm.h, gui/gdmlogin.c, config/gdm.conf.in:  Add options
	  for setting the initial position to allow xinerama users to
	  make their login not suck too much.  Also added an option to
	  lock the window position and fixed some braindamages.  Fixed the
	  label style setting as well to work with non default themes.

Thu Jan 25 06:34:13 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* gui/gdmlogin.c: workaround non-working grabs, add a window title,
	  implement window moving (poor mans support of xinerama) and other
	  cleanup and fixes

Tue Jan 23 18:09:01 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/slave.c: minor cleanups

Tue Jan 23 03:34:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/xdmcp.c: some cleanup in hunt for a fix of xdmcp

Mon Jan 22 21:02:19 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.c, daemon/slave.c, daemon/display.c, daemon/xdmcp.c: fix
	  some xdmcp bugs, crashes, etc... random cleanup, autologin on the
	  first display started only, when killing things make sure kill
	  succeeded before waitpid, otherwise probably the process was
	  already dead and we'd just wait forever.  But don't expect XDMCP
	  to actually work now, it doesn't.

Mon Jan 22 02:59:22 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/misc.c, daemon/server.[ch], daemon/slave.c,
	  daemon/display.c:  Race fixes, remove old code, cleanups,
	  leak fixes, use the same X server process and use HUP to
	  reset it

Wed Jan 10 19:25:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* configure.in, *: raise version and put in some notes in relevant
	  files

Wed Jan 10 13:57:56 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/display.c, daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/server.c,
	  daemon/slave.c:  A little bit of cleanup, if the greeter
	  segs 5 times during 40 seconds, unmanage the display
	  so that we don't hog the console.

Wed Jan 10 07:22:29 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/server.[ch], daemon/slave.c: When slave is exiting
	  we should kill the old X server really.  It should be possible to
	  reuse, but currently this was leading to hangs.  Also only
	  wait for the server if the kill worked to avoid hanging in
	  waitpid.

Wed Jan 10 03:20:48 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: add empty line for automatic login (disabled)

	* daemon/server.c: If the server aborts during startup try restarting
	  it about 5 times

Wed Jan 10 02:32:52 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/verify.h, daemon/verify-*.[ch], daemon/slave.c: For
	  autologin we have to do the pam dance to setup stuff nicely.

Wed Jan 10 01:13:54 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, gui/gdmlogin.c,
	  config/gdm.conf.in:  Move the background stuff to greeter as that
	  makes more sense

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c: Add automatic logging in on the
	  first login (so most likely right after boot).  This is off by
	  default of course and will not autologin root.

Tue Jan 09 21:55:26 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* daemon/gdm.[ch], daemon/slave.c, config/gdm.conf.in:  Add support
	  for running a background process and have it have the same lifetime
	  as the greeter.  This makes it easy to add things like screensavers
	  on the root and make them stop when you actually log in.

Tue Jan 09 18:50:51 2001  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* Many changes, too many to write a changelog for.  Applied most of
	  the redhat and helix patches.  On the login screen make a window
	  over the entire window and proxy key events back to the entry to
	  get xdm like keyboard grab behaviour without a grab.  When starting
	  local displays call gdm_display_manage to actually fork the slave.
	  Try cleaning up after self when messing with signal handlers.
	  When killing clients, ignore x errors.  Kill clients on the same
	  display connection since opening a new one won't work.  Kill the
	  alarm on the ping since it made no sense, and didn't work in the
	  first place.

2000-12-17  Marius Andreiana  <mandreiana@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in: Added ro (Romanian) to ALL_LINGUAS

2000-12-12  Mathieu Lacage  <mathieu@eazel.com>

	Make it: 1) compile 2) pass make distcheck.
	* configure.in: one BAD BAD typo: s/aC/AC/
	* daemon/Makefile.am: add server.h
	* docs/C/Makefile.am: remove images.
	* docs/C/gdm.sgml: fix sgml.
	* po/Makefile.in.in: I dunno.

2000-11-28 Stanislav Visnovsky <visnovsky@nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added Slovak translation

2000-10-19  Yukihiro Nakai  <nakai@gnome.gr.jp>

	* configure.in: Add Chinese(GB2312, Big5) to ALL_LINGUAS

2000-08-29 Carlos Perelló Marín <carlos@hispalinux.es>

	* config/gdm.conf.in: Added the Spanish welcome message

2000-08-24 Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@computer.org>

2000-07-30  Christopher R. Gabriel  <cgabriel@softwarelibero.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): added Italian translation

2000-06-18  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

	* daemon/misc.c,
	daemon/misc.h,
	daemon/slave.c,
	configure.in: Thread-safe wrapper for gdm_setenv, new function
	gdm_unsetenv. Change required for gdm basic functionality on some
	systems. On systems without setenv/unsetenv functions, gdm_(un)setenv
	still remains thread unsafe & POSIX safe!

2000-06-05  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

	* daemon/gdm.c: Typo fix.

2000-05-11  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): added Catalan file

2000-04-20  Ruben Lopez <ryu@mundivia.es>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): added Galician (gl) translation

2000-04-20  Pablo Saratxaga <pablo@mandrakesoft.com>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): added Lithuanian file

2000-02-29  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

	* daemon/verify-shadow.c: Typo bug fixed.
	* config/Makefile.am: Allow make install from separate dir.

1999-12-31    <mkp@mkp.net>

	* daemon/gdm.c (gdm_child_handler): Major overhaul.

	(gdm_slave_get_opts): Make the strings empty at startup.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_logo_init): Use gnome-pixmap
	widget instead of gtk-pixmap.  Gnome-pixmap correctly uses the
	right visual and is simpler to use (and does not crash on
	multidepth visuals).
	(gdm_greeter_iconify_handler): Use gnome-pixmao here too.

	buffer has an undefined value.

	* src/gdm.c (main): Set the umask to 066 to make any
	default file created indirectly by gnome-config be of mode 066. 

1999-01-13  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

1999-01-12  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

 	here. Now a generic function.

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_windows_kill_error_handler): Ok,
 	nailed down the bug which caused gdmslave to exit(1)
 	mysteriously. A race in the windows_recursive_kill function caused
 	the X default error handler to kick in. Blam. You're dead.
	
	(gdm_slave_session_init): Run sanity check on ~user/.Xauthority
 	and ~user/.gnome/gdm.

	(gdm_slave_exec_command): Use the passed pointer instead of

 	as default.
	
	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_login_entry_handler): Fixed event
 	handlers to avoid the obscure emit_stop bug. Turns out my ancient

 	gnome_question_dialog instead of message_box.

1998-12-03  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* config/Makefile.am: Fixed gnomerc. Both path and INSTALL_SCRIPT

1998-11-20  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c: Fixed X server restart stuff. gdmslave rewrite
 	done.

	* src/gdmslave.c, src/gdm.c, config/gdm.conf.in: Implemented
 	KillInitClients option (Requested by sct).

1998-11-18  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_display_init): Finally nailed down the
 	bug that has been haunting me for the past week causing
 	gdm_slave_windows_kill to hang on second login. The X server takes
 	a while to recover consciousness after a reset. I take this into
 	account by sleeping for a while if XOpenDisplay fails.
	Unfortunately, dsp was already initialized in second run
 	(but invalid after the X server reset) causing my retry condition
 	to be ignored. Always check your pointers! *sigh*

	So, the new gdm should be as fast as xdm (i.e. fewer resets
 	causing garbled displays and momentary flicker. Visual annoyances
 	beyond this point - Go bug the X server people).
	
	SANE tutorial coming up in 6 hours. *Thud*

 	searching and gdmLogDir. gdmLogFile deprecated.

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_init): Moved stdout, stderr logging
 	here. Logs are now per-display.

1998-11-08  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* #include<errno.h> in *.c.

1998-11-02  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_session_init): Reset display instead
 	of restarting the X server every time.

1998-10-30  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmmisc.c (gdm_arg_munch): Zero out the remaining
 	argv-entries. We use the static array several times.

 	by both gdm.c and gdmslave.c.

1998-10-20  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c: Send STX through pipeline before sending a
 	command.

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_display_init): Added STX for greeter
 	communications to avoid problems with Gtk debug errors to stdout.

1998-10-18  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_browser_init): Icon List is born
	in frozen state, calling freeze and thaw leaves it still in frozen
	state (as we have a frozen counter instead of a flag these days.).

1998-10-16  Christopher Blizzard  <blizzard@appliedtheory.com>

	* config/Makefile.am (install-data-hook): Make sure that
 	install-data-hook depends on targets gdm.conf gnomerc and Gnome.
	Otherwise they are never built.  Also, if the directories that
 	these files are supposed to go in don't exist, create them with
 	the proper mode.

1998-10-13  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_login_entry_handler): Fix use of
	the gnome_icon_list_moveto routine
	(gdm_greeter_browser_update): ditto.
	(gdm_greeter_browser_init): Adapt to the new gnome-icon-list api.
	(gdm_greeter_login_entry_handler): Thaw before attempting to use moveto

	Martin, is there any reason why you clear() the icon lists
	contents and then reload them when the user changes from the login
	field to the password one?
	
1998-10-13  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdm.c (main): Redirect all output to a logfile.
	
	* src/gdm.c (main): Moved the pid checking code to main to avoid
 	/sbin/init respawns. Checks whether gdm is started by init and
 	stops forking if this is the case (actually works this time).

	* config/gdm.conf.in (PidFile): I've been ignoring all bug reports
 	caused by this one. Turns out I made a typo in the config template
 	file. *sigh*

1998-10-11  Carsten Schaar  <nhadcasc@fs-maphy.uni-hannover.de>

	* src/Makefile.am (gdm_LDADD): Added '$(INTLLIBS).
	(gdmgreeter_LDADD): Likewise.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_invalid_passwd_req): Set focus to
 	passwd field when auth fails.

	* src/gdmslave.c: Finished the rewrite. Should be almost usable
 	again.

	* config/Makefile.am: TODO: Need to find a way to prevent
 	overwriting gdm.conf when doing a make install.

1998-10-07  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_login): Completely new

	* src/gdmverify.c: New file. TODO: PAM detection in autoconf.

	* src/gdmslave.c: Gave up on merging CVS and my .ch-work. Started
 	major rewrite instead.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c: Removed `:' in pipe communication
 	protocol. Waste.

1998-10-05  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c: Fixed the race reported on gnome-list the right
 	way. The posted fix broke X USR1 signalling.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_about): Bumped version
 	number. Whee.
	(gdm_greeter_done): New function. Partly replaces parse_results().
	(gdm_greeter_login): Former login_button_handler. Now passes
 	password through pipe. Disables input while gdmslave is thinking.
	(gdm_greeter_passwd_entry_handler): Replaced parse_results with
 	gdm_greeter_login to reflect the auth redesign.
	(gdm_greeter_invalid_passwd_req): Re-enable input and reset cursor
 	after requester has been acked.
	(main): Added signal handling for gdmslave communication.

1998-10-04  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdm.c: signal->sigaction stuff.
	(gdm_daemonify): Moved openlog to main.
	(main): Stop forking when ppid is init.

1998-10-01  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_init): Setup the signal before
	forking.  FIXME: We need to use sigaction all over the place
	instead of signal.

Thu Sep 24 22:09:39 CEST 1998 Jochen Friedrich <jochen@scram.de>

	* src/gdmgreeter.c: Fixed a memory corruption.

1998-09-15  Martin Kasper Petersen  <mkp@mkp.net>

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_usr1_handler): Added support for

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_user_alloc): Fix my oversimplication
	from last night.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_user_alloc): More simplification
	of the use of gnome-config.  I think I really should document it. 

	* src/gdm.h (gdm_slave_init): Add prototype.  Remove include to
	gnome.h.

	* src/gdmslave.c (gdm_slave_usr1_handler): Log errors when the
	session can not be launched.
	Simplify the includes.

	* src/gdmgreeter.c (gdm_greeter_parse_config): Simplify the code
	by using gnome_config_push_prefix
	(gdm_greeter_parse_config): Do not strdup the resulting strings,
	they are already dupped
	(gdm_greeter_sessions_init): Removed dependency on static buffer
	for s.  Find correctly the default session.

Tue Sep  8 16:11:49 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean

	* acconfig.h : added this file so one can cvs -z3 co gdm, cd gdm
	./autogen.sh; make and have an executable be spit out.
