        Introduction
      </title>

      <para> 
        The Gnome Display Manager (GDM) is a display manager that
        implements all significant features required for managing
        local and remote displays.   GDM was written from scratch and
        does not contain any XDM / X Consortium code.
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that GDM is highly configurable, and many configuration
        settings can affect security.  Issues to be aware of are highlighted
        in this document and in the GDM Configuration files.
      </para> 

      <para>
        For further information about GDM, see the
        <ulink type="http" url="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/">
        the GDM project website</ulink>.  Please submit any bug reports or
        enhancement requests to the &quot;gdm&quot; category in
        <ulink type="http" url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">bugzilla.gnome.org</ulink>.
        You can also send a message to the 
        <address><email>gdm-list@gnome.org</email></address> mail list to
        discuss any issues or concerns with the GDM program.

        Interface Stability
      </title>

      <para>
        The key/value pairs defined in the GDM configuration files and
        the location of these files are considered &quot;stable&quot; interfaces
        should only change in ways that are backwards compatible.  Note that
        this includes functionality like the GDM scripts (Init, PreSession,
        PostSession, PostLogin, XKeepsCrashing, etc.); directory locations
        (ServAuthDir, PidFile, etc.), system applications (SoundProgram), etc.
        Some configuration values depend on OS interfaces may need to be
        modified to work on a given OS.  Typical examples are HaltCommand,
        RebootCommand, CustomCommands, SuspendCommand, StandardXServer, Xnest,
        SoundProgram, and the &quot;command&quot; value for each
        &quot;server-foo&quot;.
      </para>

      <para>
        Command-line interfaces for GDM programs installed to
        <filename>&lt;bin&gt;</filename> and <filename>&lt;sbin&gt;</filename>
        are considered stable.  Refer to your distribution documentation to see
        if there are any distribution-specific changes to these GDM interfaces
        and what support exists for them.
      </para>

      <para>
        As of the GDM 2.15 development series, some one-dash arguments are no
        longer supported.  This includes the &quot;-xdmaddress&quot;,
        &quot;-clientaddress&quot;, and &quot;-connectionType&quot; arguments
        used by <command>gdmchooser</command>.  These arguments have been
        changed to now use two dashes.
      </para>

      <para>
        If issues are discovered that break compatibility, please file a bug
        with an &quot;urgent&quot; priority.

    <sect2 id="daemonov">
      <title>The GDM Daemon</title>
      
      <para>
        The GDM daemon is responsible for managing displays on the system.
        This includes authenticating users, starting the user session, and
        terminating the user session.  GDM is configurable and the ways it can
        be configured are described in the &quot;Configuring GDM&quot; section
        of this document.  The <filename>Init</filename>,
        <filename>PostLogin</filename>, <filename>PreSession</filename>, 
        and <filename>PostSession</filename> scripts discussed below are 
        discussed in this &quot;Configuring GDM section&quot;.
      </para>

      <para>
        The GDM daemon supports a UNIX domain socket protocol which can be used
        to control aspects of its behavior and to query information.  This
        protocol is described in the &quot;Controlling GDM&quot; section of
        this document.  
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM can be asked to manage a display a number of ways.  Local displays
        are always managed when GDM starts and will be restarted when a user's
        session is finished.  Displays can be requested via XDMCP, flexible
        displays can be requested by running the
        <command>gdmflexiserver</command> command.  Displays that are started
        on request are not restarted on session exit.  GDM also provides the
        <command>gdmdynamic</command> command to allow easier management of
        displays on a multi-user server.  These display types are discussed
        further in the next section.  
      </para>
        
      <para>
        When the GDM daemon is asked to manage a display, it will fork an
        X server process, then run the <filename>Init</filename> script as the
        root user, and start the login GUI dialog as a slave process on the
        display.  GDM can be configured to use either
        <command>gdmgreeter</command> (the default) or
        <command>gdmlogin</command> as the GUI dialog program.  The
        <command>gdmlogin</command> program supports accessibility while the
        <command>gdmgreeter</command> program supports greater themeability.
        The GUI dialog is run as the unpriviledged &quot;gdm&quot; user/group
        which is described in the &quot;Security&quot; section below.  The GUI
        dialog communicates with the daemon via a sockets protocol and via
        standard input/output.  The slave, for example passes the username and
        password information to the GDM daemon via standard input/output so
        the daemon can handle the actual authentication.
      </para>

      <para>
        The login GUI dialog screen allows the user to select which session
        they wish to start and which language they wish to use.  Sessions are
        defined by files that end in the .desktop extension and more
        information about these files can be found in the
        &quot;Configuration&quot; section.  The user enters their name and
        password and if these successfully authenticate, GDM will start the
        requested session for the user.  It is possible to configure GDM to
        avoid the authentication process by turning on the Automatic or Timed
        Login features in the GDM configuration.  The login GUI can also be
        configured to provide additional features to the user, such as the
        Face Browser; the ability to halt, restart, or suspend the system;
        and/or edit the login configuration (after entering the root password).
      </para>

      <para> 
        GDM, by default, will use Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for
        authentication, but can also support regular crypt and shadow passwords
        on legacy systems.  After authenticating a user, the daemon runs the
        <filename>PostLogin</filename> script as root, and forks a slave
        process to start the requested session.  This slave process runs the
        <filename>PreSession</filename> script as root, sets up the user's
        environment, and starts the requested session.  GDM keeps track of the
        user's default session and language in the user's
        <filename>~/.dmrc</filename> and will use these defaults if the user
        did not pick a session or language in the login GUI.  On Solaris, GDM
        (since version 2.8.0.3) uses the SDTLOGIN interface after user
        authentication to tell the X server to be restarted as the user instead
        of as root for added security.  When the user's session exits, the GDM
        daemon will run the <filename>PostSession</filename> script as root.
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that, by default, GDM uses the &quot;gdm&quot; service name for
        normal login and the &quot;gdm-autologin&quot; service name for
        automatic login.  The <filename>PamStack</filename> configuration
        option can be used to specify a different service name.  For example,
        if &quot;foo&quot; is specified, then GDM will use the &quot;foo&quot;
        service name for normal login and &quot;foo-autologin&quot; for
        automatic login. 
      </para>

      <para>
        For those looking at the code, the gdm_verify_user function in 
        <filename>daemon/verify-pam.c</filename> is used for normal login
        and the gdm_verify_setup_user function is used for automatic login.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="displaytypes">
      <title>Different Display Types</title>

      <para>
        GDM supports three different display types: static (local) displays,
        flexible (on-demand) displays, and XDMCP (remote) displays.  The
        &quot;X Server Definitions&quot; subsection of the
        &quot;Configuration&quot; section explains how the X server is
        configured for different displays.
      </para>

      <para>
        Static (local) displays are always started by the daemon, and when they
        die or are killed, they are restarted.  GDM can run as many of these
        as needed.  GDM can also manage displays on which it does not manage a
        GUI login, thus GDM can be used for supporting X terminals.
        The &quot;Local Static X Display Configuration&quot; subsection of
        the &quot;Configuration&quot; section describes how Static (local)
        displays are defined.
      </para>

      <para>
        Flexible, or on demand displays are only available to users logged
        in on the console.  Starting a flexible display will lock the current
        user session and will show a new login screen over the current running
        session.  If at least one flexible display is already running, and the
        user requests another, then a dialog will display showing existing
        flexible displays.  The user can choose to switch back to a previous
        display or start a new flexible display.  If the user switches back
        to a previous display, they will need to enter the password in the
        lock screen program to return to their session.  The GDM configuration
        file specifies the maximum number of flexible displays allowed on the
        system.
      </para>

      <para>
        Flexible displays may be started by running the
        <command>gdmflexiserver</command> command, or via calling the GDM
        socket protocol directly.  Some lock screen programs provide a button
        to start a new flexible session.  This allows a user to start a new
        session even if the screen was left locked.  The GNOME Fast User
        Switch applet also uses the socket protocol to provide an applet
        interface on the GNOME panel for managing user displays quickly.
        Flexible displays are not restarted when the user session ends.
        Flexible displays require virtual terminal (VT) support in the kernel,
        and will not be available if not supported (such as on Solaris). 
       </para>

       <para>
        The <filename>FlexibleXServers</filename>,
        <filename>FirstVT=7</filename>, <filename>VTAllocation</filename>,
        and <filename>FlexiReapDelayMinutes</filename> configuration settings
        are used to configure how flexible displays operate.
       </para>

       <para>
        Nested displays are available to users even if not logged in on the
        console.  Nested displays launch a login screen in a window in the 
        user's current session.  This can be useful if the user has more
        than one account on a machine and wishes to login to the other
        account without disrupting their current session.  Nested displays
        may be started by running the <command>gdmflexiserver -n</command>
        command or via calling the GDM socket protocol directly.  Nested
        displays require that the X server supports a nested X server command
        like Xnest or Xephyr.  The <filename>Xnest</filename> configuration
        option is used to configure how nested displays operate
      </para>

      <para>
        The <command>gdmdynamic</command> is similar to
        <command>gdmflexiserver</command> in the sense that it allows the
        user to manage displays dynamically.  However displays started with
        <command>gdmdynamic</command> are treated as local displays, so 
        they are restarted automatically when the session exits.  This 
        command is intended to be used in multi-user server environments
        (many displays connected to a single server).  In other words,
        this command allows the displays to be managed without hardcoding
        the display information in the &quot;Local Static X Display
        Configuration&quot; section of the configuration file.  This
        is useful to support the ability of adding new displays to the
        server without needing to restart GDM, for example.
      </para>

      <para>
        The last display type is the XDMCP remote displays which are described
        in the next section.  Remote hosts can connect to GDM and present the
        login screen if this is enabled.  Some things are different for
        remote sessions.  For example, the Actions menu which allows you to
        shut down, restart, suspend, or configure GDM are not shown.
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="xdmcp">
      <title>
        XDMCP
      </title>

      <para>
        The GDM daemon can be configured to listen for and manage X Display
        Manage Protocol (XDMCP) requests from remote displays.  By default
        XDMCP support is turned off, but can be enabled if desired.  If GDM is
        built with TCP Wrapper support, then the daemon will only grant access
        to hosts specified in the GDM service section in the TCP Wrappers
        configuration file.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM includes several measures making it more resistant to denial of
        service attacks on the XDMCP service.  A lot of the protocol
        parameters, handshaking timeouts etc. can be fine tuned. The defaults
        should work for most systems, however.  Do not change them unless you
        know what you are doing.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM listens to UDP port 177 and will respond to QUERY and
        BROADCAST_QUERY requests by sending a WILLING packet to the originator.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM can also be configured to honor INDIRECT queries and present a
        host chooser to the remote display.  GDM will remember the user's
        choice and forward subsequent requests to the chosen manager.  GDM
        also supports an extension to the protocol which will make it forget
        the redirection once the user's connection succeeds.  This extension
        is only supported if both daemons are GDM.  It is transparent and
        will be ignored by XDM or other daemons that implement XDMCP.
      </para>

      <para>
        Refer to the &quot;Security&quot; section for information about
        security concerns when using XDMCP.

    <sect2 id="secureremote">
      <title>
        Securing Remote Connection Through SSH
      </title>
      <para>
        As explained in the &quot;Security&quot; section, XDMCP does not use
        any kind of encryption and as such is inherently insecure.  As XDMCP
        uses UDP as a network transport layer, it is not possible to simply
        secure it through an SSH tunnel.
      </para>

      <para>
        To remedy this problem, gdm can be configured at compilation-time with
        the option --enable-secureremote, in which case gdm proposes as a
        built-in session a session called &quot;Secure Remote Connection&quot;.
        Starting such a session allows the user to enter the name or the
        address of the host on which to connect; provided the said host runs an
        SSH server, the user then gets connected to the server on which the
        default X session is started and displayed on the local host.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Using this session allows a much more secure network connection and
        only necessitates to have an SSH server running on the remote host.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gtkgreeter">
      <title>The GTK+ Greeter</title>

      <para>
        The GTK+ Greeter is the default graphical user interface that is
        presented to the user. The greeter contains a menu at the top, an
        optional face browser, an optional logo and a text entry widget.
        This greeter has full accessibility support, and should be used
        by users with accessibility needs.
      </para>

      <para>
        The text entry field is used for entering logins, passwords,
        passphrases etc. <command>gdmlogin</command> is controlled by the
        underlying daemon and is basically stateless. The daemon controls the
        greeter through a simple protocol where it can ask the greeter for a
        text string with echo turned on or off. Similarly, the daemon can
        change the label above the text entry widget to correspond to the
        value the authentication system wants the user to enter.
      </para>

      <para>
        The menu bar in the top of the greeter enables the user to select the
        requested session type/desktop environment, select an appropriate
        locale/language, halt/restart/suspend the computer, configure GDM
        (given the user knows the root password), change the GTK+ theme, or
        start an XDMCP chooser.
      </para>

      <para>
        The greeter can optionally display a logo in the login window.  The
        image must be in a format readable to the gdk-pixbuf library (GIF,
        JPG, PNG, TIFF, XPM and possibly others), and it must be readable to
        the GDM user. See the <filename>Logo</filename> option in the
        reference section below for details.

        The Themed Greeter is a greeter interface that takes up the whole
        screen and is very themable.  Themes can be selected and new themes
        can be installed by the configuration application or by setting the
        <filename>GraphicalTheme</filename> configuration key.  The Themed
        Greeter is much like the GTK+ Greeter in that it is controlled by
        the underlying daemon, is stateless, and is controlled by the
        daemon using the same simple protocol.
      </para>

      <para>
        The look and feel of this greeter is really controlled by the theme and
        so the user interface elements that are present may be different.  The
        only thing that must always be present is the text entry field as
        described above in the GTK+ Greeter.  The theme can include buttons
        that allow the user to select an appropriate locale/language,
        halt/restart/suspend the computer, configure GDM (given the user
        knows the root password), or start an XDMCP chooser.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can always get a menu of available actions by pressing the F10 key.
        This can be useful if the theme doesn't provide certain buttons when
        you wish to do some action allowed by the GDM configuration.

      <title>The GDM Face Browser</title>

      <para>
        GDM supports a face browser which will display a list of users who
        can login and an icon for each user.  This feature can be used with
        the GTK+ Greeter if the <filename>Browser</filename> configuration
        option is set to &quot;true&quot;.  This feature can be used with
        the Themed Greeter if using a GDM theme which includes a
        &quot;userlist&quot; item type is defined, such as
        &quot;happygnome-list&quot;
      </para>

      <para>
        By default, the face browser is disabled since revealing usernames on
        the login screen is not appropriate on many systems for security 
        reasons.  Also GDM requires some setup to specify which users should
        be visible.  Setup can be done on the &quot;Users&quot; tab in
        <command>gdmsetup</command>.  This feature is most practical to use
        on a system with a smaller number of users.
      </para>

      <para>
        The icons used by GDM can be installed globally by the sysadmin or can
        be located in the users' home directories.  If installed globally
        they should be in the <filename>&lt;share&gt;/pixmaps/faces/</filename>
        directory (though this can be configured with the
        <filename>GlobalFaceDir</filename> configuration option) and the
        filename should be the name of the user, optionally with a
        <filename>.png</filename> appended.  Face icons placed in the global
        face directory must be readable to the GDM user.  However, the daemon,
        proxies user pictures to the greeter and thus those do not have be be
        readable by the &quot;gdm&quot; user, but root.
      </para>

      <para>
        Users may run the <command>gdmphotosetup</command> command to 
        configure the image to use for their userid.  This program properly
        scales the file down if it is larger than the
        <filename>MaxIconWidth</filename> or 
        <filename>MaxIconHeight</filename> configuration options and places the
        icon in a file called <filename>~/.face</filename>.  Although
        <command>gdmphotosetup</command> scales user images automatically,
        this does not guarantee that user images are properly scaled since
        a user may create their <filename>~/.face</filename> file by hand.
      </para>
        
      <para>
        GDM will first look for the user's face image in
        <filename>~/.face</filename>.  If not found, it will try 
        <filename>~/.face.icon</filename>.  If still not found, it will
        use the value defined for &quot;face/picture=&quot; in the 
        <filename>~/.gnome2/gdm</filename> file.  Lastly, it will try
        <filename>~/.gnome2/photo</filename> and 
        <filename>~/.gnome/photo</filename> which are deprecated and
        supported for backwards compatibility.
      </para>

      <para>
        If a user has no defined face image, GDM will use the
        &quot;stock_person&quot; icon defined in the current GTK+ theme.  If no
        such image is defined, it will fallback to the image specified in the
        <filename>DefaultFace</filename> configuration option, normally
        <filename>&lt;share&gt;/pixmaps/nobody.png</filename>.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Please note that loading and scaling face icons located in user home
        directories can be a very time-consuming task.  Since it not 
        practical to load images over NIS or NFS, GDM does not attempt to
        load face images from remote home directories.  Furthermore, GDM will
        give up loading face images after 5 seconds of activity and will
        only display the users whose pictures it has gotten so far.  The
        <filename>Include</filename> configuration option can be used to
        specify a set of users who should appear on the face browser.  As
        long as the users to include is of a reasonable size, there should
        not be a problem with GDM being unable to access the face images.
        To work around such problems, it is recommended to place face images
        in the directory specified by the <filename>GlobalFaceDir</filename>
        configuration option.
      </para>

      <para>
        To control the users who get displayed in the face browser, there are
        a number of configuration options that can be used.  If the
        <filename>IncludeAll</filename> option is set to true, then the
        password file will be scanned and all users will be displayed.  If
        <filename>IncludeAll</filename> option is set to false, then the
        <filename>Include</filename> option should contain a list of users
        separated by commas.  Only the users specified will be displayed.
        Any user listed in the <filename>Exclude</filename> option and users
        whose UID's is lower than <filename>MinimalUID</filename> will be
        filtered out regardless of the <filename>IncludeAll</filename>
        setting.  <filename>IncludeAll</filename> is not recommended
        for systems where the passwords are loaded over a network (such as
        when NIS is used), since it can be very slow to load more than a
        small number of users over the network..
      </para>

      <para>
        When the browser is turned on, valid usernames on the computer are
        inherently exposed to a potential intruder.  This may be a bad idea if
        you do not know who can get to a login screen.  This is especially
        true if you run XDMCP (turned off by default).

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="logging">
      <title>Logging</title>

      <para>
        GDM itself will use syslog to log errors or status.  It can also log
        debugging information, which can be useful for tracking down problems
        if GDM is not working properly.  This can be enabled in the 
        configuration file.
      </para>

      <para>
        Output from the various X servers is stored in the GDM log directory,
        which is configurable, but is usually
        <filename>&lt;var&gt;/log/gdm/</filename>.  The output from the
        session can be found in a file called
        <filename>&lt;display&gt;.log</filename>.  Four older files are also
        stored with <filename>.1</filename> through 
        <filename>.4</filename> appended.  These will be rotated as new
        sessions on that display are started.  You can use these logs to view
        what the X server said when it started up.
      </para>

      <para>
        The output from the user session is redirected to
        <filename>~/.xsession-errors</filename>
        before even the <filename>PreSession</filename> script is started.  So
        it is not really necessary to redirect this again in the session setup
        script.  As is usually done.  If the user session lasted less then
        10 seconds, GDM assumes that the session crashed and allows the user to
        view this file in a dialog before returning to the login screen.
        This way the user can view the session errors from the last session
        and correct the problem this way.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can suppress the 10 second warning by returning code 66 from the
        <filename>Xsession</filename>script or from your session binary (the
        default <filename>Xsession</filename> script propagates those codes
        back).  This is useful if you have some sort of special logins for
        which it is not an error to return less then 10 seconds later, or if
        you setup the session to already display some error message and the
        GDM message would be confusing and redundant.
      </para>

      <para>
        The session output is piped through the GDM daemon and so the
        <filename>~/.xsession-errors</filename> file is capped at about
        200 kilobytes by GDM to prevent a possible denial of service attack
        on the session.  An application could perhaps on reading some wrong
        data print out warnings or errors on the stderr or stdout.  This could
        perhaps fill up the user's home directory making it necessary to log
        out and back into their session to clear this.  This could be
        especially nasty if quotas are set.  GDM also correctly traps the XFSZ
        signal and stops writing the file, which would lead to killed sessions
        if the file was redirected in the old fashioned way from the script.
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that some distributors seem to override the
        <filename>~/.xsession-errors</filename> redirection and do it
        themselves in their own Xsession script (set by the
        <filename>BaseXsession</filename> configuration key) which means that
        GDM will not be able to trap the output and cap this file.  You also
        lose output from the <filename>PreSession</filename> script which can
        make debugging things harder to figure out as perhaps useful output
        of what is wrong will not be printed out.  See the description of the
        <filename>BaseXsession</filename> configuration key for more
        information, especially on how to handle multiple display managers
        using the same script.
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that if the session is a failsafe session, or if GDM can't open
        this file for some reason, then a fallback file will be created in the
        <filename>/tmp</filename> directory named
        <filename>/tmp/xses-&lt;user&gt;.XXXXXX</filename> where the
        <filename>XXXXXX</filename> are some random characters.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you run a system with quotas set, it would be good to delete the
        <filename>~/.xsession-errors</filename> in the
        <filename>PostSession</filename> script.  Such that this log file
        doesn't unnecessarily stay around.

      <title>Accessing Files</title>

      <para>
        In general GDM is very reluctant regarding reading/writing of user
        files (such as the <filename>~/.dmrc</filename>,
        <filename>~/.face</filename>,
        <filename>~/.xsession-errors</filename>, and
        <filename>~/.Xauthority</filename> files).  For instance it refuses to
        access anything but regular files.  Links, sockets and devices are
        ignored.  The value of the <filename>RelaxPermissions</filename>
        parameter determines whether GDM should accept files writable by the
        user's group or others.  These are ignored by default.
      </para>

      <para>
        All operations on user files are done with the effective user id of the
        user.  If the sanity check fails on the user's
        <filename>.Xauthority</filename> file, a fallback cookie is created in
        the directory specified by the <filename>UserAuthFBDir</filename>
        configuration setting (<filename>/tmp</filename> by default).
      </para>

      <para>
        Finally, the sysadmin can specify the maximum file size GDM should
        accept, and, if the face browser is enabled, a tunable maximum icon
        size is also enforced.  On large systems it is still advised to turn
        off the face browser for performance reasons.  Looking up icons in
        home directories, scaling and rendering face icons can take a long
        time.

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="performance">
      <title>GDM Performance</title>

      <para>
        To speed performance it is possible to build GDM so that it will
        preload libraries when GDM first displays a greeter program.  This
        has been shown to speed first time login since these libraries can
        be loaded into memory while the user types in their username and
        password.
      </para>

      <para>
        To use this feature, configure GDM with the
        <command>--with-prefetch</command> option.  This will cause GDM to
        install the <command>gdmprefetch</command> program to the
        <filename>libexecdir</filename> directory, install the
        <filename>gdmprefetchlist</filename> to the
        <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm</filename> directory, and set the
        <filename>PreFetchProgram</filename> configuration variable so that the
        <command>gdmprefetch</command> program is called with the default
        <filename>gdmprefetchlist</filename> file.  The default
        <filename>gdmprefetchlist</filename> file was optimized
        for a GNOME desktop running on Solaris, so may need fine-tuning on
        other systems.  Alternative prefetchlist files can be contributed
        to the &quot;gdm&quot; category in
        <ulink type="http" url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">bugzilla.gnome.org</ulink>,

      </title>

      <para>
        GDM uses PAM for login authentication, though if your machine does not
        support PAM you can build GDM to work with the password database and
        the crypt library function.
      </para>

      <para>
        PAM stands for Pluggable Authentication Module, and is used by most
        programs that request authentication on your computer.  It allows the
        administrator to configure different authentication behavior for
        different programs.
      </para>

      <para>
        Some GDM features (like turning on automatic login) may require that
        you update your PAM configuration.  PAM configuration has different,
        but similar, interfaces on different operating systems, so check your
        pam.d or pam.conf man page for details.  Be sure that you read the
        PAM documentation (e.g. pam.d/pam.conf man page) and are comfortable
        with the security implications of any changes you intend to make to
        your configuration.
      </para>

      <para>
        If there is no entry for GDM in your system's PAM configuration file,
        then features like automatic login may not work.  Not having an entry
        will cause GDM to use default behavior, conservative settings are
        recommended and probably shipped with your distribution.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you wish to make GDM work with other types of authentication
        mechanisms (such as a SmartCard), then you should implement this by
        using a PAM service module for the desired authentication type rather
        than by trying to modify the GDM code directly.  Refer to the PAM
        documentation on your system.  This issue has been discussed on the
        <address><email>gdm-list@gnome.org</email></address> mail list,
        so you can refer to the list archives for more information.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, an effective way to implement such an exotic
        authentication mechanism would be to have a daemon running
        on the server listening to the authentication device (e.g.
        USB key, fingerprint reader, etc.).  When the device 
        announces that it has received input, then the daemon can
        set the <filename>PamStack</filename> configuration value
        using per-display configuration, and restart the greeter
        with the PAM stack that works with this device.  This avoids
        needing to hack the display manager code directly to support
        the feature.

      <title>The GDM User</title>

      <para>
        For security reasons a dedicated user and group id are required for
        proper operation!  The need to be able to write Xauth files is why user
        &quot;nobody&quot; is not appropriate for gdm.
      </para>

      <para>
        The GDM daemon normally runs as root, as does the slave.  However GDM
        should also have a dedicated user id and a group id which it uses for
        its graphical interfaces such as <command>gdmgreeter</command> and
        <command>gdmlogin</command>.  These are configured via the
        <filename>User</filename> and <filename>Group</filename>
        configuration options in the GDM configuration files.  The user and
        group should be created before running &quot;make install&quot;.  By
        default GDM assumes the user and the group are called &quot;gdm&quot;. 
      </para>

      <para>
        This userid is used to run the GDM GUI programs required for login.
        All functionality that requires root authority is done by the GDM
        daemon process.  This design ensures that if the GUI programs are
        somehow exploited, only the dedicated user privileges are available.
      </para>

      <para>
        It should however be noted that the GDM user and group have some
        privileges that make them somewhat dangerous.  For one, they have
        access to the X server authorization directory.  It must be able to
        read and write Xauth keys to <filename>&lt;var&gt;/lib/gdm</filename>.
        This directory should have root:gdm ownership and 1770 permissions.
        Running &quot;make install&quot; will set this directory to these
        values.  The GDM daemon process will reset this directory to proper
        ownership/permissions if it is somehow not set properly.
      </para>

      <para>
        The danger is that someone who gains the GDM user/group privileges can
        then connect to any session.  So you should not, under any
        circumstances, make this some user/group which may be easy to get
        access to, such as the user <filename>nobody</filename>.  Users who
        gain access to the &quot;gdm&quot; user could also modify the Xauth
        keys causing Denial-Of-Service attacks.  Also if a person gains the
        ability to run programs as the user &quot;gdm&quot;, it would be
        possible to snoop on running GDM processes, including usernames and
        passwords as they are being typed in.  
      </para>

      <para>
        Distributions and system administrators using GDM are expected to setup
        the dedicated user properly.  It is recommended that this userid be
        configured to disallow login and to not have a default shell.
        Distributions and system administrators should set up the filesystem to
        ensure that the GDM user does not have read or write access to
        sensitive files.

      <title>X Server Authentication Scheme</title>
 
      <para>
        The X server authorization directory (the
        <filename>ServAuthDir</filename>) is used for a host of random
        internal data in addition to the X server authorization files, and the
        naming is really a relic of history.  GDM daemon enforces this
        directory to be owned by <filename>root.gdm</filename> with the
        permissions of 1770.  This way, only root and the GDM group have write
        access to this directory, but the GDM group cannot remove the root
        owned files from this directory, such as the X server authorization
        files.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM by default doesn't trust the X server authorization directory and
        treats it in the same way as the temporary directory with respect to
        creating files.  This way someone breaking the GDM user cannot mount
        attacks by creating links in this directory.  Similarly the X server
        log directory is treated safely, but that directory should really be
        owned and writable only by root.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM only supports the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 X server authentication
        scheme.  Normally little is gained from the other schemes, and no
        effort has been made to implement them so far.  Be especially
        careful about using XDMCP because the X server authentication cookie
        goes over the wire as clear text.  If snooping is possible, then an
        attacker could simply snoop your authentication password as you log in,
        regardless of the authentication scheme being used.  If snooping is
        possible and undesirable, then you should use ssh for tunneling an X
        connection rather then using XDMCP.  You could think of XDMCP as a sort
        of graphical telnet, having the same security issues.
      </para>

      <para>
        On the upside, GDM's random number generation is very conservative and
        GDM goes to extraordinary measures to truly get a 128 bit random
        number, using hardware random number generators (if available), plus
        the current time (in microsecond precision), a 20 byte array of
        pseudorandom numbers, process pid's, and other random information
        (possibly using <filename>/dev/audio</filename> or
        <filename>/dev/mem</filename> if hardware random generators are not
        available) to create a large buffer and then run MD5 digest on this.
        Obviously, all this work is wasted if you send this cookie over an open
        network or store it on an NFS directory (see
        <filename>UserAuthDir</filename> configuration key).  So be careful
        about where you use remote X display.

      <para>
        Even though GDM tries to outsmart potential attackers trying to take
        advantage of XDMCP, it is still advised that you block the XDMCP port
        (normally UDP port 177) on your firewall unless you really need it.
        GDM guards against DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, but the X protocol
        is still inherently insecure and should only be used in controlled
        environments.  Also each remote connection takes up lots of resources,
        so it is much easier to DoS via XDMCP then a webserver.

        It is also wise to block all of the X Server ports.  These are TCP
        ports 6000 + the display number of course) on your firewall.  Note that
        GDM will use display numbers 20 and higher for flexible on-demand
        servers.

        Note that NFS traffic really goes &quot;over the wire&quot; and thus
        can be snooped.  When accessing the user's X authorization file
        (<filename>~/.Xauthority</filename>), GDM will try to open the file
        for reading as root.  If it fails, GDM will conclude that it is on an
        NFS mount and it will automatically use
        <filename>UserAuthFBDir</filename>, which by default is set to
        <filename>/tmp</filename>.  This behavior can be changed by setting the

        XDMCP is primarily useful for running thin clients such as in terminal
        labs.  Those thin clients will only ever need the network to access
        the server, and so it seems like the best security policy to have
        those thin clients on a separate network that cannot be accessed by
        the outside world, and can only connect to the server.  The only point
        from which you need to access outside is the server.

    <title>Support for ConsoleKit</title>

    <para>
      GDM includes support for publishing user login information with the user
      and login session accounting framework known as ConsoleKit.  ConsoleKit
      is able to keep track of all the users currently logged in.  In this
      respect, it can be used as a replacement for the utmp or utmpx files that
      are available on most Unix-like operating systems.
    </para>

    <para>
      When GDM is about to create a new login process for a user it will call
      a privileged method of ConsoleKit in order to open a new session for this
      user.  At this time GDM also provides ConsoleKit with information about
      this user session such as: the user ID, the X11 Display name that will be
      associated with the session, the host-name from which the session
      originates (useful in the case of an XDMCP session), whether or not this
      session is local, etc.  As the entity that initiates the user process,
      GDM is in a unique position know and to be trusted to provide these bits
      of information about the user session.  The use of this privileged method
      is restricted by the use of D-Bus system message bus security policy.
    </para>

    <para>
      In the case where a user with an existing session and has authenticated
      at GDM and requests to resume that existing session GDM calls a
      privileged method of ConsoleKit to unlock that session.  The exact
      details of what happens when the session receives this unlock signal is
      undefined and session-specific.  However, most sessions will unlock a
      screensaver in response.

      When the user chooses to log out, or if GDM or the session quit
      unexpectedly the user session will be unregistered from ConsoleKit.

      The <command>gdmsetup</command> application can be used to configure GDM.
      If you believe running root-owned GUI's causes security risk, then you
      would want to always edit the files by hand and not use
      <command>gdmsetup</command>.  Editing the files by hand is explained in
      the &quot;Configuration&quot; section of this document.  Note that 
      <command>gdmsetup</command> does not support changing of all
      configuration variables, so it may be necessary to edit the files by
      hand for some configurations.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <command>gdmsetup</command> program has five tabs: Local, Remote,
      Accessibility, Security, and Users, described below.  In parenthesis is
      information about which GDM configuration key is affected by each GUI
      choice.  Refer to the &quot;Configuration&quot; section of this manual

    <sect2 id="gdmsetuplocaltab">
      <title>Local Tab</title>
     
      <para>
        The Local tab is used for controlling the appearance of GDM for
        local/static displays (non-XDMCP remote connections).  The choices
        available in this tab depend on the setting of the &quot;Style&quot;
        combobox.  This combobox is used to determine whether the 
        &quot;Plain&quot; or &quot;Themed&quot; greeter GUI is used.  The
        differences between these greeter programs are explained in the
        &quot;Overview&quot; section of this document.
      </para>

      <para>
        If the &quot;Style&quot; choice is &quot;Plain&quot;, then GDM will
        use the <command>gdmlogin</command> program as the GUI
        (daemon/Greeter).  When this choice is selected,
        <command>gdmsetup</command> allows the user to select whether the
        background is an image or solid color (greeter/BackgroundType).  If
        image is selected, there is a file selection button to pick the image
        file (greeter/BackgroundImage) and a checkbox to scale the image to fit
        the screen (greeter/BackgroundImageScaleToFit).  If solid color is
        selected, there is a button available to allow the color selection
        (greeter/BackgroundColor).  Also, the user may select the logo image
        that appears in gdmlogin (greeter/Logo).
      </para>

      <para>
        If the &quot;Style&quot; choice is &quot;Plain with face browser&quot;,
        then the <command>gdmlogin</command> program is used as the GUI
        (daemon/Greeter) and the face browser is turned on (greeter/Browser).
        The Face Browser is explained in the Overview section.  Otherwise,
        the choices are the same as when the &quot;Style&quot; choice is
        &quot;Plain&quot;.  Additional setup in the Users tab may be 
        necessary to choose which users appear in the Face Browser.
      </para>

      <para>
        If the &quot;Style&quot; choice is &quot;Themed&quot;, then the 
        <command>gdmgreeter</command> program is used as the GUI
        (daemon/Greeter).  When this choice is selected,
        <command>gdmsetup</command> allows the user to select the theme to be
        used (greeter/GraphicalTheme).  Note that the checkbox to the left
        of the theme's name must be checked for a theme to be selected.
        Clicking on the theme, but not selecting the checkbox will highlight
        the theme and the &quot;Remove&quot; button can be used to delete
        the theme.  Information about the theme's author and copyright are
        shown for the highlighted theme.  The &quot;Add&quot; button can be
        used to add new themes to the system.  To turn on the Face Browser, a
        theme which includes a Face Browser must be selected, such as 
        happygnome-list.  The &quot;Background color&quot; displayed when
        GDM starts (and if the theme has transparent elements) can also be
        selected (greeter/GraphicalThemedColor).  The &quot;Theme&quot; combo
        box may be set to &quot;Random from selected&quot; if you want a random
        theme to be used for each login (greeter/GraphicalThemeRand and
        greeter/GraphicalThemes).  To use random themes, select each theme that
        you wish to be used.  By default this combobox is set to
        &quot;Selected only&quot;, so that only a single theme can be selected
        and be used.
      </para>

      <para>
        Regardless of the &quot;Style&quot; choice, the user may also select
        whether the Actions menu is visible (greeter/SystemMenu), whether the

        (greeter/ConfigAvailable), and whether the Action menu includes the
        choice to start <command>gdmchooser</command> to run a remote XDMCP
        login session (greeter/ChooserButton).  Note that the root password
        must be entered to start <command>gdmsetup</command> from the login
        screen if it is enabled.   Also the Welcome message displayed for local
        sessions may be selected (greeter/DefaultWelcome and greeter/Welcome). 
        The Welcome message can contain the character sequences described in

        comfortable with the XDMCP-related sections of the Security section
        of this document before enabling it.  This tab includes a

        control the appearance of GDM for remote users (gui/RemoteGreeter
        and xdmcp/Enable).  This combobox may be set to &quot;Remote login
        disabled&quot; or &quot;Same as Local&quot;.  If the Local tab
        is set to &quot;Plain&quot; or &quot;Plain with Face Browser&quot;,

        is set to &quot;Themed&quot;, then the user may also select
        &quot;Plain&quot; or &quot;Plain with face browser&quot;.  It is
        recommended that the &quot;Plain&quot; GUI be used for remote
        connections since it is more lightweight and tends to have better
        performance across a network.
      </para>

      <para>
        If Remote login is enabled, then the user can specify the remote
        Welcome Message to be displayed (greeter/DefaultRemoteWelcome and

        Local welcome message and can have a different value.  The Welcome
        message can contain the character sequences described in the

      <para>
        If the &quot;Style&quot; choice is enabled and set to a different

        There is also a checkbox to allow users to change the theme when using 
        the Plain greeter (gui/AllowGtkThemeChange).  This feature allows GDM
        users to switch the theme to the HighContrast or LowContrast themes if
        needed.  The user may also select whether GDM should play a sound when
        the login screen is ready, when login is successful and when login has

      subdirectory, and are a separate topic.  Read the default files provided,
      they have adequate documentation.  Again normally the default install
      is given in the files with <filename>factory</filename> in their name,
      and those files are not read, they are just there for you so you can
      always revert to default config.

      Files describing available GDM session follow the freedesktop.org
      desktop file specification.  The <filename>.desktop</filename>-style
      files are installed to <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/X11/sessions/</filename>.
      This directory is also read by the KDE desktop manager (KDM) for common
      configuration.  Next the directory
      <filename>&lt;share&gt;/gdm/BuiltInSessions/</filename> is read for
      GDM specific built-in sessions (KDM hardcodes these at time of
      this writing).  Lastly the default setup will also read
      <filename>&lt;share&gt;/xsessions/</filename> (which should be
      <filename>&lt;share&gt;/xsessions/</filename> if you really wish to
      cooperate with KDM) where desktop packages can install their session
      files.  The directories under the <filename>&lt;etc&gt;</filename> should
      be reserved for configuration.  The desktop file specification approach
      makes it easy for package management systems to install window managers
      and different session types without requiring the sysadmin to edit files.
      See the <filename>SessionDesktopDir</filename> configuration key for
      changing the paths.  It used to be that GDM stored its built in
      sessions in <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/dm/Sessions/</filename> but this is
      deprecated as of 2.5.90.0.  Note that prior to version 2.4.4.2 only the
      <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/dm/Sessions/</filename> was being read.

      A session can be disabled (if it was installed in
      <filename>&lt;share&gt;/xsessions/</filename>) by adding an identically
      named <filename>.desktop</filename> to one of the directories earlier in
      the path (likely <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/X11/sessions</filename>) and using
      <filename>Hidden=true</filename> in that file.

        In this section we will explain the <filename>Init</filename>,

        When the X server has been successfully started, GDM will try to run
        the script called <filename>Init/&lt;displayname&gt;</filename>. I.e.
        <filename>Init/:0</filename> for the first local display.  If this file
        is not found, GDM will attempt to to run
        <filename>Init/&lt;hostname&gt;</filename>. I.e.
        <filename>Init/somehost</filename>.
        If this still is not found, GDM will try
        <filename>Init/XDMCP</filename> for all XDMCP logins or
        <filename>Init/Flexi</filename> for all on demand flexible
        displays.  If none of the above were found, GDM will run
        <filename>Init/Default</filename>. The script will be run as root and
        GDM blocks until it terminates. Use the <filename>Init/*</filename>
        script for applications that are supposed to run alongside with the GDM
        login window. xconsole for instance.  Commands to set the background
        etc. go in this file too.
      </para>

      <para> 
        It is up to the sysadmin to decide whether clients started by the Init
        script should be killed before starting the user session. This is
        controlled with the <filename>KillInitClients</filename> configuration
        option.
      </para>

      <para>
        When the user has been successfully authenticated GDM tries the
        scripts in the <filename>PostLogin</filename> directory in the same
        manner as for the <filename>Init</filename> directory.  This is done
        before any session setup is done, and so this would be the script where
        you might setup the home directory if you need to (though you should
        use the <filename>pam_mount</filename> module if you can for this).
        You have the <filename>$USER</filename> and
        <filename>$DISPLAY</filename> environment variables set for this
        script, and again it is run as root.  The script should return 0 on
        success as otherwise the user won't be logged in.  This is not true for
        failsafe session however.
      </para>

      <para>
        After the user session has been setup from the GDM side of things, GDM
        will run the scripts in the <filename>PreSession</filename> directory,
        again in the same manner as the <filename>Init</filename> directory.
        Use this script for local session management or accounting stuff.  The
        <filename>$USER</filename> environment variable contains the login of
        the authenticated user and <filename>$DISPLAY</filename> is set to the
        current display.  The script should return 0 on success.  Any other
        value will cause GDM to terminate the current login process.  This is
        not true for failsafe sessions however.  Also
        <filename>$X_SERVERS</filename> environmental variable is set and this
        points to a fake generated X servers file for use with the sessreg
        accounting application.
      </para>

      <para>
        After this the base <filename>Xsession</filename> script is run with
        the selected session executable as the first argument.  This is run as
        the user, and really this is the user session.  The available session
        executables are taken from the <filename>Exec=</filename> line in the
        <filename>.desktop</filename> files in the path specified by
        <filename>SessionDesktopDir</filename>.  Usually this path is
        <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/X11/sessions/:&lt;etc&gt;/dm/Sessions:/usr/share/xsessions/</filename>.
        The first found file is used.  The user either picks from these
        sessions or GDM will look inside the file <filename>~/.dmrc</filename>
        for the stored preference.
      </para>

      <para>
        This script should really load the user's profile and generally do all
        the voodoo that is needed to launch a session.  Since many systems
        reset the language selections done by GDM, GDM will also set the
        <filename>$GDM_LANG</filename> variable to the selected language.  You
        can use this to reset the language environmental variables after you
        run the user's profile.  If the user elected to use the system language,
        then <filename>$GDM_LANG</filename> is not set. 
      </para>

      <para> 
        When the user terminates his session, the
        <filename>PostSession</filename> script will be run. Again operation
        is similar to <filename>Init</filename>, <filename>PostLogin</filename>
        and <filename>PreSession</filename>.  Again the script will be run with
        root privileges, the slave daemon will block and the
        <filename>$USER</filename> environment variable will contain the name
        of the user who just logged out and <filename>$DISPLAY</filename> will
        be set to the display the user used, however note that the X server for
        this display may already be dead and so you shouldn't try to access it.
        Also <filename>$X_SERVERS</filename> environmental variable is set and
        this points to a fake generated X servers file for use with the sessreg
        accounting application.
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that the <filename>PostSession</filename> script will be run
        even when the display fails to respond due to an I/O error or
        similar. Thus, there is no guarantee that X applications will work
        during script execution.
      </para>

      <para>
        Except for the <filename>Xsession</filename> script all of these
        scripts will also have the environment variable
        <filename>$RUNNING_UNDER_GDM</filename> set to
        <filename>yes</filename>, so that you could perhaps use similar
        scripts for different display managers.  The
        <filename>Xsession</filename> will always have the
        <filename>$GDMSESSION</filename> set to the basename of the
        session that the user chose to run without the
        <filename>.desktop</filename> extension.  In addition
        <filename>$DESKTOP_SESSION</filename> is also set to the same value
        and in fact this will also be set by KDM in future versions.
      </para>

      <para> 
        Neither of the <filename>Init</filename>,
        <filename>PostLogin</filename>, <filename>PreSession</filename> or
        <filename>PostSession</filename> scripts are necessary and can be left
        out.  The <filename>Xsession</filename> script is however required as
        well as at least one session <filename>.desktop</filename> file.

      <title>The Configuration Files - GDM System Defaults Configuration File
             and GDM Custom Configuraiton File</title>
      
      <para>
        GDM uses two configuration files: the GDM System Defaults Configuration
        File (<filename>&lt;share&gt;/gdm/defaults.conf</filename>) and the
        GDM Custom Configuration File
        (<filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/custom.conf</filename>).  The GDM System
        Defaults File contains the default configuration choices for GDM, and
        should not be modified by the user.  The GDM Custom Configuration File
        is where users may specify their custom configuration choices.  
        If a configuration option is not defined in either file, GDM will
        default to the value described in the comments in the GDM System
        Defaults Configuration File. 
      </para>

      <para>
        Both configuration files are divided into sections each containing
        variables that define the behavior for a specific part of the GDM
        suite.  Refer to the comments in the GDM System Defaults Configuration
        File for additional information about each configuration setting.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM also supports per-display configuration for parameters in the
        &quot;gui&quot;, &quot;greeter&quot; sections of the configuration file
        Also the security/PamStack key may be customized per-display.
        Per-display configuration is specified by creating a file named
        <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/custom.conf&lt;display num&gt;</filename>.
        In this file the section and keys to use on this display can be 
        specified.  For example, configuration overrides for display
        &quot;:103&quot; would be stored in the file
        <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/custom.conf:0</filename>.  Per-display
        configuration is supported in GDM 2.14.6 and later.
      </para>

      <para>
        To change configuration by hand, edit the GDM Custom Configuration File
        or per-display configuration file and make sure the keyname=value
        pair you want is included in the appropriate section.  For example,
        to change the value for the &quot;Greeter&quot; key in the
        &quot;daemon&quot; section, make sure the daemon section of the GDM
        Custom Configuration File or per-display configuration file includes
        the &quot;[daemon]&quot; section followed by the key and value 
        change desired.  As in this example:
      </para>

<screen>
[daemon]
Greeter=/usr/lib/gdmgreeter
</screen>

      <para>
        The <command>gdmsetup</command> command can be used to modify the GDM
        Custom Configuration File.  Note the <command>gdmsetup</command> is
        intended to be run as root, so users who feel it is insecure to run
        GUI programs as root should edit the configuration files by hand.
      </para>

      <para>
        The GDM daemon <command>--config</command> argument may instead be used
        to specify a different configuration file location.  The GDM daemon
        must be restarted to change the configuration file being used.  Also
        when building GDM, the location of the configuration files may be
        specified via the <command>--with-defaults-conf</command> and
        <command>--with-custom-conf</command> configuration options.
      </para>

      <para>
        Previous to GDM 2.13.0.4 only the
        <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/gdm.conf</filename> existed.  For best
        backwards compatibility, this file will be used instead of the GDM
        Custom Configuration File if it exists on your system.  If upgrading
        to the new version of GDM, &quot;make install&quot; will check to see
        if the <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/gdm.conf</filename> file is different
        than the <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/factory-gdm.conf</filename> file.
        If so, the <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/gdm.conf</filename> file will be 
        automatically copied to
        <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/custom.conf</filename> to preserve any
        configuration changes.
      </para>
        
      <para>
        Distributions should edit the GDM System Defaults Configuration File to
        establish default configuration values, so that they are preserved as
        defaults and not modified by users modifying the GDM Custom
        Configuration File.  Note that distributions may modify the GDM System
        Defaults Configuration File on update to improve usability, security,
        etc.  So any changes made to this file may be lost.
      </para>

      <para>
        The GDM System Defaults Configuration File and the GDM Custom
        Configuration File follow the standard <filename>.ini</filename> style
        configuration file syntax.  Keywords in brackets define sections,
        strings before an equal sign (=) are variables and the data after
        equal sign represents their value.  Empty lines or lines starting with
        the hash mark (#) are ignored.  The graphical configurator will try to
        preserve both comments (lines with a hash mark) and the overall
        structure of the file so you can intermix using the GUI or hand
        editing the configuration file.

                If true, then gdm never tries to reuse existing X servers by
                reinitializing them.  It will just kill the existing X server
                and start over.  Normally, just reinitializing is a nicer way
                to go but if the X server memory usage keeps growing this may
                be a safer option.  On Solaris, this value is always true, and
                this configuration setting is ignored.

                <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/profile</filename> and friends.  The
                standard script shipped with GDM sources the files in this
                order: <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/profile</filename> then
                <filename>~/.profile</filename> then
                <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/xprofile</filename> and finally
                <filename>~/.xprofile</filename>.  Note that different
                distributions may change this however.  Sometimes users
                personal setup will be in <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename>,
                however broken that is.

                the sysadmin (avoids running malicious startup scripts).

                gdmprefetch command may be used.  This utility will load any
                libraries passed in on the command line, or if the argument
                starts with a &quot;@&quot; character, it will process the file assuming
                it is an ASCII file containing a list of libraries, one per

                 If the user given in <filename>TimedLogin</filename> should be

                <filename>TimedLoginDelay</filename>) of inactivity on the

                hits the ENTER key while the login program is requesting the
                username, then GDM will assume the user wants to login
                immediately as the timed user.  Note that no password will be
                asked for this user so you should be careful, although if using
                PAM it can be configured to require password entry before
                allowing login.

                The directory where user's <filename>.Xauthority</filename>
                file should be saved.  When nothing is specified the user's
                home directory is used.  This is tilde expanded so you
                can set it to things like: <filename>~/authdir/</filename>.
              </para>

              <para>
                If you do not use the tilde expansion, then the filename
                created will be random, like in
                <filename>UserAuthFBDir</filename>.  This way many users can
                have the same authentication directory.  For example you might
                want to set this to <filename>/tmp</filename> when user has the
                home directory on NFS, since you really don't want cookie files
                to go over the wire.  The users should really have write
                privileges to this directory, and this directory should really
                be sticky and all that, just like the <filename>/tmp</filename>
                directory.
              </para>

              <para>
                Normally if this is the user's home directory GDM will still
                refuse to put cookies there if it thinks it is NFS (by testing
                root-squashing).  This can be changed by setting
                <filename>NeverPlaceCookiesOnNFS</filename> in the
                <filename>[security]</filename> section to false.

                before writing to them, this prevents security issues in case
                of bad setup.  However in some instances home directories will
                be owned by a different user and in this case it is necessary
                to turn this option on.  You will also most likely have to
                turn the <filename>RelaxPermissions</filename> key to at least
                value 1 since in such a scenario home directories are likely
                to be group writable.  Supported since 2.6.0.4.

                is on NFS.  Well, GDM will consider any filesystem with

                file system can have root squashing and be safe (perhaps by

                When the machine sends a WILLING packet back after a QUERY it
                sends a string that gives the current status of this server.
                The default message is the system ID, but it is possible to
                create a script that displays customized message.  If this
                script doesn't exist or this key is empty the default message
                is sent.  If this script succeeds and produces some output,
                the first line of it's output is sent (and only the first
                line).  It runs at most once every 3 seconds to prevent
                possible denial of service by flooding the machine with QUERY
                packets.

                which for example Red Hat uses.  That is, the users can't pick
                the last session and will just then get the default session
                (see <filename>DefaultSession</filename>) unless then pick
                something else for this session only.  So if this is off, this

                don't have to worry about remote users having any sort of

        <title>X Server Definitions</title>

        <para>
          To set up X servers, you need to provide GDM with information about
          the installed X servers.  You can have as many different definitions
          as you wish, each identified with a unique name.  The name
          <filename>Standard</filename> is required.  If you do not specify
          this server, GDM will assume default values for a 'Standard' server
          and the path given by <filename>daemon/StandardXServer</filename>.
          <filename>Standard</filename> is used as the default,
          in situations when no other server has been defined.
        </para>

        <para>
          Servers are defined by sections named <filename>server-</filename>
          followed by the identifier of this server.  This should be a simple
          ASCII string with no spaces.  The GUI configuration program allows
          users to edit the servers defined in the GDM configuration files
          but currently does not allow adding or deleting entries.  Like normal
          configuration options, <filename>server-</filename> sections in the
          GDM Custom Configuration File override values in the GDM System
          Defaults Configuration File.  In other words, if a
          <filename>server-Standard</filename> section is defined in the GDM
          Custom Configuration File, then that will be used and the section in
          the GDM System Defaults Configuration File will be ignored.

                useful to run an X terminal using GDM.  When this is done you
                should normally also add <filename>-terminate</filename> to the

                each session.  Otherwise the control of the slave will never
                come back to GDM and, for example, soft restarts won't work.
                This is because GDM assumes there is a login in progress for

        <para>
          The static display configuration specifies what displays should be
          always managed by GDM.  GDM will restart the X server on the display
          if it dies, for example.  There may be as many static displays that
          are managed as you wish, although typically each display is 
          associated with a real display.  For example, if a machine has two
          displays (say display &quot;:0&quot; and display &quot;:1&quot;),
          then this section can be used to specify that a separate login
          screen be managed for each screen.  Each key in the
          <filename>[servers]</filename> section corresponds to the display
          number to be managed.  Normally there is only one key, which is the
          key <filename>0</filename>, which corresponds to the display
          <filename>:0</filename>.
        </para>

        <para>
          The GUI configuration program allows users to edit the static display

                The command can either be a path to an X executable, or a name

                The gdm daemon doesn't enforce the numbers to be in order or
                for them to be &quot;packed&quot;.  They keyword
                &quot;inactive&quot; can be used instead of a command to
                specify that the display should be not managed.  This can be
                used in the GDM Custom Configuration File to turn off a 
                display that is defined in the GDM System Defaults
                Configuration File.

                On some systems it is necessary for GDM to know on which

                (if running XFree86) add &quot;vt7&quot; to the command line,
                for example, to run on virtual console 7.  However on Linux and

      <title>Per User Configuration</title>

      <para>
        There are some per user configuration settings that control how GDM
        behaves.  GDM is picky about the file ownership and permissions of 
        the user files it will access, and will ignore files if they are not
        owned by the user or files that have group/world write permission.
        It will also ignore the user if the user's $HOME directory is not
        owned by the user or if the user's $HOME directory has group/world
        write permission.  files must also be smaller than the
        <filename>UserMaxFile</filename> value as defined in the GDM
        configuration.  If it seems that GDM is not properly accessing 
        user configuration settings, the problem is most likely 
        caused by one of these checks failing.
      </para>

      <para>
        First there is the <filename>~/.dmrc</filename> file.  In
        theory this file should be shared between GDM and KDM, so users only
        have to configure things once.  This is a standard
        <filename>.ini</filename> style configuration file.  It has one section
        called <filename>[Desktop]</filename> which has two keys:
        <filename>Session</filename> and <filename>Language</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <filename>Session</filename> key specifies the basename of the
        session <filename>.desktop</filename> file that the user wishes to
        normally use (without the <filename>.desktop</filename> extension, in
        other words).  The <filename>Language</filename> key specifies the
        language that the user wishes to use by default.  If either of these
        keys is missing, the system default is used.  The file would normally
        look as follows:
      </para>

<screen>
[Desktop]
Session=gnome
Language=cs_CZ.UTF-8
</screen>

      <para>
        Normally GDM will write this file when the user logs in for the first
        time, and rewrite it if the user chooses to change their default values
        on a subsequent login. 
      </para>

      <para>
        If the GDM Face Browser is turned, then the file
        <filename>$HOME/.face</filename> is accessed.  This file should be a 
        standard image that GTK+ can read, such as PNG or JPEG.  It also must
        be smaller than the <filename>MaxIconWidth</filename> and 
        <filename>MaxIconHeight</filename> values defined in the GDM
        configuration or it will be ignored.  Users can run the
        <command>gdmphotosetup</command> program to specify a face image
        and it will copy the file to the <filename>$HOME/.face</filename>
        location and scale it so its longest dimension is not larger than the 
        <filename>MaxIconWidth</filename> or <filename>MaxIconHeight</filename>
        values.  <command>gdmphotosetup</command> takes care to not change
        the aspect ratio of the image.

        Face images can also be placed in the global face directory, which is
        specified by the <filename>GlobalFaceDir</filename> configuration 
        option ( normally <filename>&lt;share&gt;/pixmaps/faces/</filename>)
        and the filename should be the name of the user, optionally with a

        <command>gdm-restart</command> command which is also in the
        <filename>&lt;sbin&gt;/</filename> directory.  To restart GDM but only
        after all the users have logged out, you can either send the USR1
        signal to the main daemon or run the
        <command>gdm-safe-restart</command> command which is in the

        The <command>gdmflexiserver</command> command can be used to start
        new flexible (on demand) displays if your system supports virtual
        terminals.  This command will normally lock the current session with a
        screensaver so that the user can safely walk away from the computer and
        let someone else log in.  If more that two flexible displays have 
        started <command>gdmflexiserver</command> will display a pop-up dialog
        allowing the user to select which session to continue.  The user will
        normally have to enter a password to return to the session.  On session
        exit the system will return to the previous virtual terminal.  Run
        <command>gdmflexiserver --help</command> to get a listing of possible

        (usually <filename>&lt;var&gt;/gdm/.gdmfifo</filename>).  You must be
        root to use this protocol, and it is mostly used for internal GDM
        chatter.  It is a very simple protocol where you just echo a command on
        a single line to this file.  It can be used to tell GDM things such as
        restart, suspend the computer, or restart all X servers next time it has
        a chance (which would be useful from an X configuration application).

  &lt;logged in user&gt; can be empty in case no one logged
  in yet, and &lt;vt&gt; can be -1 if it's not known or not
  supported (on non-Linux for example).  If the display is an
  xnest display and is a console one (that is, it is an xnest
  inside another console display) it is listed and instead of
  vt, it lists the parent display in standard form.

AUTH_LOCAL: Setup this connection as authenticated for

            (non-nested) displays can be started only from
            users logged in locally, and here GDM assumes
            only users logged in from GDM.  They must pass
            the xauth MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 that they were passed
            before the connection is authenticated.
Note:       The AUTH LOCAL command requires the
            --authenticate option, although only
            FLEXI XSERVER uses this currently.
Note:       Since 2.6.0.6 you can also use a global
            &lt;ServAuthDir&gt;/.cookie, which works for all
            authentication except for SET_LOGOUT_ACTION and

Note:        Supported on older version from 2.2.4.0, later
             2.2.4.2, but since 2.3.90.4 you must supply 4
             arguments or ERROR 100 will be returned.  This

             same as the owner of that file (and same as

             the third argument for this display, to prove
             that you indeed are this user.  Also this file
             must be readable ONLY by this user, that is
             have a mode of 0600.  If this all is not met,
             ERROR 100 is returned.
Note:        The cookie should be the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1,

                         that SET_LOGOUT_ACTION has precedence
                         over SET_SAFE_LOGOUT_ACTION if it is set
                         to something other then NONE.  If no one
                         is logged in, then the action takes effect
                         effect immediately.  Only supported on
                         connections that passed AUTH_LOCAL.

UPDATE_CONFIG: Tell the daemon to re-read a key from the 
               GDM configuration file.   Any user can request
               that values are re-read but the daemon will
               only do so if the file has been modified
               since GDM first read the file.  Only users
               who can change the GDM configuration file
               (normally writable only by the root user) can
               actually modify the GDM configuration.  This
               command is useful to cause the GDM to update
               itself to recognize a change made to the GDM
               configuration file by the root user.

               Starting with version 2.13.0.0, all GDM keys are
               supported except for the following:

                      daemon/PidFile
                      daemon/ConsoleNotify
                      daemon/User

                      daemon/UserAuthFile
                      daemon/UserAuthFBDir

               GDM also supports the following Psuedokeys:

               xdmcp/PARAMETERS (2.3.90.2) updates the following:
                      xdmcp/MaxPending

                      xdmcp/PingIntervalSeconds (only affects new connections)

                xservers/PARAMETERS (2.13.0.4) updates the following:
                      all [server-foo] sections.

        <para>
          The <command>gdmXnestchooser</command> command automatically gets
          the correct display number, sets up access, and runs the nested
          X server command with the &quot;-indirect localhost&quot; argument.
          This provides an XDMCP chooser program. You can also supply as an
          argument the hostname whose chooser should be displayed, so
          <command>gdmXnestchooser somehost</command> will run the XDMCP
          chooser from host <command>somehost</command> inside a nested
          X server session.  You can make this command do a direct query
          instead by passing the <command>-d</command> option as well.  In
          addition to the following options, this command also supports
          standard GNOME options.

        <para>
         The <command>gdmflexiserver</command> command provides three 
         features.  It can be used to run flexible (on demand) X displays,
         to run a flexible display via nested X server, and to send commands to
         the GDM daemon process.
        </para>

        <para>
         Starting a flexible X display will normally lock the current session
         with a screensaver and will redisplay the GDM login screen so a second
         user can log in.   This feature is only available on systems that
         support virtual terminals and have them enabled.  This feature is
         useful if you are logged in as user A, and user B wants to log in
         quickly but user A does not wish to log out.  The X server takes
         care of the virtual terminal switching so it works transparently.
         If there is more than one running display defined with flexible=true,
         then the user is shown a dialog that displays the currently running
         sessions.  The user can then pick which session to continue and will
         normally have to enter the password to unlock the screen. 
        </para>

        <para>
         Nested displays works on systems that do not support virtual 
         terminals.  This option starts a flexible display in a window in the
         current session.  This does not lock the current session, so is not
         as secure as a flexible server started via virtual terminals.
        </para>

        <para>
         The <command>gdmflexiserver --command</command> option provides a way
         to send commands to the GDM daemon and can be used to debug problems

         This is a tool for viewing a theme outside of GDM.  It is useful for

         viewing the themes in different modes via the environment option.
         Valid environment values and their meanings follow:

<screen>
console       - In console mode.
console-timed - In console non-flexi mode.
flexi         - In flexi mode.
xdmcp         - In remote (XDMCP) mode.

      <title>Theme Overview</title>

      <para>
        GDM Themes can be created by creating an XML file that follows the
        specification in gui/greeter/greeter.dtd.  Theme files are stored
        in the directory
        <filename>&lt;share&gt;/gdm/themes/&lt;theme_name&gt;</filename>.
        Usually this would be under <filename>/usr/share</filename>.  The theme
        directory should contain a file called
        <filename>GdmGreeterTheme.desktop</filename> which has similar format
        to other .desktop files and looks like:
      </para>

<screen>
[GdmGreeterTheme]
Encoding=UTF-8
Greeter=circles.xml
Name=Circles
Description=Theme with blue circles
Author=Bond, James Bond
Copyright=(c) 2002 Bond, James Bond
Screenshot=screenshot.png
</screen>

      <para>
        The Name, Description, Author and Copyright fields can be translated
        just like the other <filename>.desktop</filename>files.  All the files
        that are mentioned should be in the theme directory itself.  The
        Screenshot field points to a file which should be a 200x150 screenshot
        of the theme in action (it is OK not to have one, but it makes it nicer
        for user).  The Greeter field points to an XML file that contains the
        description of the theme.  The description will be given later.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once you have theme ready and installed you can test it with the
        installed <command>gdmthemetester</command> script.  This script
        assumes that the X server supports a nested server command.  This
        command takes two arguments, first the environment that should be used.
        This is one of console, console-timed, flexi, remote-flexi, xdmcp.
        Where console is a standard console login, console-timed is a console
        login with a timed login going on, flexi is for any local flexible
        display, remote-flexi is for flexi displays that are not local (such
        as an Xnest flexiserver run from a remote display) and xdmcp is for
        remote XDMCP connections.  The second argument is the theme name.  So
        for example to test how things look in the XDMCP mode with the circles
        theme you would run:
      </para>

<screen>
<command>gdmthemetester xdmcp circles</command>
</screen>

      <para>
        Be sure to test all the environments with your theme, and make sure to
        test how the caps lock warning looks by pressing caps lock.  This is
        also a good way to take screenshots, just take a screenshot of the
        nested display window.  This can be done in GNOME by focusing the
        nested login window and pressing Alt-PrintScreen.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once you have all this done, then make a tarball that contains the
        directory name (so that you could just untar it in the
        <filename>&lt;share&gt;/gdm/themes</filename> directory).  And this is
        the tarball you distribute and people can install from the graphical
        configuration application.  You can do this with the commands:
<screen>
cd &lt;share&gt;/gdm/themes
tar czvf &lt;theme_name&gt;.tar.gz &lt;theme_name&gt;/

            Contained within the greeter tag can be the nodes described
            in the next sections of this document.  Some of these nodes are
            containers (box nodes, rect item nodes) which can be used to
            organize how to display the nodes that the user sees and interacts

          either &quot;horizontal&quot; or &quot;vertical&quot;.  If you leave
          any property off it will default to zero or &quot;false&quot; in

          orientation.
        </para>

              <para>
                A button field.  This field uses a GTK+ button.  It is also
                possible to make a "rect" item act like a button by setting
                its button element to true.  However it is better to use
                GTK+ buttons in GDM themes since these are accessible to
                users with disabilities.  Also, GTK+ buttons can be
                themed.  This feature is supported in GDM 2.14.6 and later.

          Items can specify ID values which gives them a specific look and feel
          or formatting.  Furthermore you can customize the login process by
          adding custom widgets with custom id's for some items (currently only
          the list item)

          List items by default display as lists, but the
          combo=&quot;true&quot; attribute can be used to specify combo box
          style (combo style supported since GDM 2.16.2).  Some predefined
          lists may be included in a theme by using the following id values.
          Customized lists may also be defined, which are explained below.

                A Face Browser list, so that users can pick their username
                by clicking on this instead of typing.  This obviously exposes
                the usernames to viewers of the login screen, and is not
                recommended for users who feel that this reduces security.
                The face browser does not support combo box style.

                This id can be specified for the &lt;rect&gt; object containing
                the userlist and if the userlist is empty then this rectangle
                will not be shown.  This allows the theme to define something
                like an area with a different color and/or alpha to surround
                the userlist, but only if there are users to display.

      <sect3 id="positionnodes">
        <title>Position Node</title>

        <para>
          Each item can specify its position and size via the &quot;pos&quot;
          node.  For example:
<screen>
&lt;pos x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;4&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;
</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          Both position and size can be given in percent and it will be taken
          as the percentage of the size of the current container.  For toplevel
          items it's the percentage of the whole screen.
        </para>

        <para>
          For x and y, you can also specify a negative position which means
          position from the right or bottom edge.  But this only applies with
          absolute coordinates.  With percentage you can specify negative
          position and it will be still from the same edge.
        </para>

        <para>
          The position also specifies the anchor of the item, this can be
          &quot;n&quot; &quot;ne&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;se&quot;
          &quot;s&quot; &quot;sw&quot; &quot;w&quot; and &quot;nw&quot; or
          &quot;center&quot; which stand for the different edges/corners or
          &quot;center&quot; for center.  For example:
<screen>
&lt;pos x=&quot;10%&quot; y=&quot;50%&quot; anchor=&quot;w&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; height=&quot;95&quot;/&gt;
</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          If the item contains a box, you can specify width and height to be
          &quot;box&quot; to mean that they are supposed to be the width and
          height of the box, that is the items in the box plus the padding.
        </para>

        <para>
          If the item contains an SVG image, you can specify width and height
          to be &quot;scale&quot; to mean that the SVG image should be scaled
          to fit the requested area.
        </para>

        <para>
          You can also specify an &quot;expand&quot; property to either be
          &quot;true&quot; or false.  If true then the child will be expanded
          in the box as much as possible (that is it will be given more space
          if available).
        </para>

        <para>
          There are two extra properties you can specify (as of 2.4.4.3) for
          labels (and labels only).  The first is &quot;max-width&quot; which
          will specify the maximum width of the label in pixels.  And the
          second is &quot;max-screen-percent-width&quot; which specifies the
          maximum percentage of the screen width that the label can occupy.
          By default no label will occupy more then 90% of the screen by width.
          An example may be:
<screen>
&lt;item type=&quot;label&quot;&gt;
&lt;pos x="10%" max-screen-percent-width="50%"/&gt;
</screen>
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="shownodes">
        <title>Show Node</title>

        <para>
          Some items may only display in certain modes, like when doing a
          remote display.  Multiple values can be specified and must be
          separated with commas.  The following values are possible:
        </para>

        <para>
          <filename>console</filename> - In console mode.
        </para>
        <para>
          <filename>console-fixed</filename> - In console non-flexi mode.

        <para>

        </para>
        <para>
          <filename>remote</filename> - In remote mode.
        </para>
        <para>
          <filename>remote-flexi</filename> - In remote &amp; flexi mode.
        </para>

        <para>
          For example:
<screen>
&lt;show modes=&quot;flexi,remote&quot;/&gt;
</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          You can also specify the &quot;type&quot; value to indicate that
          certain items should only be displayed if the type is true.  Valid
          values include the following:
        </para>

        <para>
          <filename>chooser</filename>, if ChooserButton is set to
          &quot;true&quot; in the GDM configuration.
        </para>

    <title>Accessibility</title>
      <para>
        GDM supports &quot;Accessible Login&quot;, allowing users to log into
        their desktop session even if they cannot easily use the screen, mouse,
        or keyboard in the usual way.  Accessible Technology (AT) programs
        such as <command>GOK</command> (on-screen keyboard) and
        <command>orca</command> (magnifier and text-to-speech) are supported.
        The &quot;Standard Greeter&quot; best supports accessibility, so it is
        recommended for accessibility support.  The &quot;Themed Greeter&quot;
        supports some accessibility features and may be usable by some users.
        But some AT programs, such as <command>GOK</command>, do not yet work
        with the &quot;Themed Greeter&quot;.
      </para>

      <para>
        Accessibility is enabled by specifying the &quot;Standard Greeter&quot;
        in the &quot;Local&quot; tab for the console display and specifying
        the &quot;Standard Greeter&quot; in the &quot;Remote&quot; tab for 
        remote displays.  Or you can modify the <filename>Greeter</filename>
        and <filename>RemoteGreeter</filename> configuration options by hand
        to be <command>/usr/lib/gdmlogin</command>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The GDM greeter programs support the ability to launch AT's at login
        time via configurable &quot;gestures&quot;.  These gestures can be
        defined to be standard keyboard hotkeys, switch device event, or
        mouse motion events.  When using the &quot;Standard Greeter&quot;, the
        user may also change the visual appearance of the login UI.  For
        example, to use a higher-contrast color scheme for better visibility.  
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that <command>gdmsetup</command> does not yet work with
        accessibility, so that users who require AT programs should only
        configure GDM by editing the ASCII files directly.
      </para>

       <sect2 id="accessibilityconfig">
          <title>Accessibility Configuration</title>

          <para>
            In order to enable Accessible Login, the system administrator must
            make some changes to the default login configuration by manually
            modifying three human-readable configuration files, stored in
            the GDM Custom Configuration File, AccessKeyMouseEvents File, and
            AccessDwellMouseEvents File.  The AccessKeyMouseEvents and
            AccessDwellMouseEvents contain reasonable default gestures for
            launching <command>GOK</command> and <command>orca</command>, but
            some users may require these gestures to be configured to best
            meet their needs.  For example, shorter or longer duration for
            holding down a button or hotkey might make the login experience
            more usable for some users.  Also, additional AT programs may be
            added to the configuration file if needed.
          </para>

            <title>Accessibile Theming</title>

            <para>
              If using the &quot;Standard Greeter&quot; users can easily 
              switch the color and contrast scheme of the dialog.  To do this,
              ensure the <filename>AllowGtkThemeChange</filename> parameter in
              the GDM configuration is set to &quot;true&quot;.  This should
              be the default value.  When true, the &quot;Standard
              Greeter&quot; contains a menu allowing the user to change to a
              different GTK+ theme.  The <filename>GtkThemesToAllow</filename>
              configuration choice can also be used to limit the choices
              available as desired.  For example:
            </para>

<screen>
GtkThemesToAllow=HighContrast,HighContrastInverse
</screen>

            <para>
              If using the &quot;Themed Greeter&quot; there may be suitable
              GDM themes available that provide needed color and contrast 
              schemes, but these are not yet shipped with the GDM program.
              Some distributions may ship such themes.  There is not yet any
              mechanism to switch between themes in the &quot;Themed
              Greeter&quot;, so if an accessible theme is required by one
              user, then all users would need to use the same theme.

            <title>AT Program Support</title>

            <para>
              To enable user to launch AT such as the <command>GOK</command>
              or <command>orca</command>, the
              <filename>AddGtkModules</filename> parameter in the GDM
              configuration must be set to &quot;true&quot;.
              Also the <filename>GtkModulesList</filename> parameter must be
              uncommented and set as follows:
            </para>

            <para>
              This causes all GDM GUI programs to be run with the appropriate
              GTK modules for launching AT programs.  The use of assistive
              technologies and the atk-bridge module requires the registry
              daemon, <command>at-spi-registryd</command>, to be running. 
              This is handled by the GDM GUI starting with version 2.17.
            </para>

            <para>
              System administrators may wish to load only the minimum subset
              of these modules which is required to support their user base.
              The &quot;libkeymouselistener&quot; provides hotkey and switch
              gesture support while the &quot;libdwellmouselistener&quot;
              provides mouse motion gesture support.  If your user base only
              requires one or the other, it is only necessary to include the
              gesture listener that is needed.  Also, some AT programs may not
              require gail or atk-bridge.  If you find the AT programs you
              need works fine without including these, then they may be
              omitted.  Note that some AT programs work with a reduced feature
              set if gail and/or atk-bridge are not present.  However, for
              general accessibility use, including all four is suitable.
            </para>

            <para>
              Once &quot;keymouselistener&quot; and/or
              &quot;dwellmouselistener&quot; have been added to the

              need to modiify the gesture configurations to meet your user's
              needs.  Default gestures are provided for launching
              <command>GOK</command> and <command>orca</command>, but it is
              recommended to modify these gestures so they work best for your
              user base.  These gesture associations are contained in files
              <filename>AccessKeyMouseEvents</filename> and
              <filename>AccessDwellMouseEvents</filename>, respectively.  Both
              files are located in the
              <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/modules</filename> directory.  The

              The AccessKeyMouseEvents file controls the keymouselistener
              Gesture Listener and is used to define key-press, mouse button,
              or XInput device sequences that can be used to launch
              applications needed for accessibility.  In order to reduce the
              likelihood of unintentional launch, these &quot;gestures&quot;
              may be associated with multiple switch presses and/or minimum
              durations.  Note that the XKB extension is needed for key
              gestures to work, so you may need to add +xkb to your X server
              command line for gestures to work properly.  The X server command
              line is specified in the GDM configuration file in the
              &quot;server-foo&quot; sections.

              The DwellKeyMouseEvents file controls the dwellmouselistner and
              supports gestures that involve the motion of a pointing device
              such as the system mouse of an alternative pointing device such
              as a head pointer or trackball may also be defined.  Motion
              gestures are defined as &quot;crossing events&quot; into and out
              of the login dialog window.  If the
              &quot;dwellmouselistener&quot; gesture listener is loaded, then
              alternative pointing devices are temporarily &quot;latched&quot;
              to the core pointer, such that motion from alternative devices
              results in movement of the onscreen pointer.  All gestures are
              specified by the same syntax; that is, there is no distinction
              between a &quot;core mouse&quot; gesture and motion from an
              alternate input device.

              On some operating systems, it is necessary to make sure that the

              Currently GDM does not remember what accessible technology

              the user switches between the login program and the chooser, for
              example, then it is necessary for the user to redo the gesture.
              Users may need to also set up their default session so that the
              assistive technologies required are started automatically (or
              have appropriate key-bindings defined to start them) after the
              user session has started.

              Some older X servers have a bug which causes detectable
              autorepeat to fail when XEVIE is enabled (which happens when
              atk-bridge is included as a GTK Module).  This bug causes key
              gestures with a duration greater than 0 to always fail.  A
              workaround is to simply redefine all key gestures so they have
              zero length duration, or upgrade your X server.

             GDM is not yet the default login program on Solaris.  If you wish
             to switch to using GDM, then you need to turn off CDE login and
             start the GDM service.  Note that turning off or disabiling CDE
             login will cause any running sessions to immediately exit, and any
             unsaved data will be lost.  Only run these commands if you are
             sure there is no unsaved data in your running sessions.  It would
             be best to run these commands from console login, or a Failsafe
             Terminal rather than from a running GUI session.  The first step
             is to run the following command to see if CDE login is running as
             an SMF service.

             <para>
               To make /etc/logindevperm functionality work on Solaris 9 or
               earlier you would have to hack the GDM PreSession and
               PostSession script to chmod the device permissions directly.  In
               other words, if /etc/logindevperm had a listing like this:

               Then the PreSession script would need to be modified to chown
               /dev/console to the user:group who is logging into the console
               and ensure whatever permissions is specified in /etc/logindevperm
               (0600 for the line above).  Then in the PostSession script chmod
               the device back to root:root and ensure 0600 this time (do not
               use the value in the /etc/logindevperm file).  Linux uses a
               different mechanism for managing device permissions, so this
               extra scripting is not needed.

               Automatic login is a GDM feature that is not enabled by default,
               so you would only notice this problem if you try to make use of
               it.  Turning this feature on causes your computer to login to a

              GDM supports a security feature which causes the X server to

      <para>
        Suppose you want to make a lab full of X terminals that all connect
        to one server machine.  So let's call one X terminal
        <filename>xterminal</filename> and let's call the server machine
        <filename>appserver</filename>.  You install GDM on both.
      </para>

      <para>
        On <filename>appserver</filename> you enable XDMCP, so you have
<screen>
[xdmcp]
Enable=true
</screen>
        If you want no local screens here, you can then
        make the <filename>[servers]</filename> section empty.
      </para>

      <para>
        On the <filename>xterminal</filename> you disable XDMCP (you don't
        want anyone to connect to the xterminal really).  You will add a
        server type perhaps called <filename>Terminal</filename> as follows:
<screen>
[server-Terminal]
name=Terminal server
command=/path/to/X -terminate
flexible=false
handled=false
</screen>
        This definition should in fact be included in the standard
        configuration file.  Notice that we made the
        <filename>handled</filename> key false since we don't want GDM to
        handle this server localy.  Also note that we have not yet added the
        <filename>-query</filename> argument, you can add that here, or in the
        <filename>[servers]</filename> section.  We'll define our local
        servers as follows:
<screen>
[servers]
0=Terminal -query appserver
</screen>
        This will run a direct XDMCP query to the server named
        <filename>appserver</filename>.

    <sect2 id="terminallabtwo">
      <title>Terminal Lab With Two Or More Servers</title>

      <para>
        Suppose you want to make a lab full of X terminals that all connect
        to some choice of servers.  For now let's make it
        <filename>appserverone</filename> and
        <filename>appservertwo</filename>.  Again we'll call our example X
        terminal server <filename>xterminal</filename>.  The setup on both
        servers is the same as with the case of one server in the previous
        section.  You do not need to explicitly enable indirect queries on the
        server since we'll run the choosers locally on the X terminals.
      </para>

      <para>
        So on the <filename>xterminal</filename> you again disable XDMCP.
        You will add a server type perhaps called <filename>Chooser</filename>
        as follows:
<screen>
[server-Chooser]
name=Chooser server
command=/path/to/X
flexible=false
chooser=true
</screen>
        And again this definition should in fact be included in the standard
        configuration file.  Notice that we made the
        <filename>chooser</filename> key true here.  This will run the XDMCP
        chooser for this server, and when the user chooses a host GDM will run
        a query for that host.  Then we will define our local servers as
        follows:
<screen>
[servers]
0=Chooser
</screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        The XDMCP chooser on the X terminal will normally give a broadcast
        query to see which servers exist on the network.  If the two servers
        are not reachable by a broadcast query, you must add them by hand to
        the configuration file.  So in the <filename>[chooser]</filename>
        section you would have:
<screen>
Hosts=appserverone,appservertwo
</screen>
        and any other servers you wish the users to be able to connect to.
      </para>

      <para>
        Sometimes you may want to run the chooser on the server side however.
        Then what you want to do is to run a configuration similar to the
        previous section about the one server configuration with XDMCP
        indirect queries enabled on <filename>appserver</filename> and on the
        X terminals you'd have
<screen>
[servers]
0=Terminal -indirect appserver
</screen>
        This way for example you only have to maintain one
        <filename>Hosts</filename> entry.  However as a disadvantage then,
        the <filename>appserver</filename> must then always be available.  So
        it's not good for situations where you want to have several servers
        and not all of them have to be on all the time.  You could also have
        one of the X terminals handle indirect XDMCP queries and serve up the
        chooser to the other X terminals.

      <para>
        Note, that besides being able to customise this option to reboot into

    <title>Troubleshooting</title>

    <para>
      This section discusses helpful tips for getting GDM working.  In general,
      if you have a problem using GDM, you can submit a bug to the
      &quot;gdm&quot; category in
      <ulink type="http"
       url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">bugzilla.gnome.org</ulink>
      or send an email to the
      <address><email>gdm-list@gnome.org</email></address> mail list.
    </para>

    <para>
      If GDM is failing to work properly, it is always a good idea to include
      debug information.  Use the <command>gdmsetup</command> command to turn
      on debug (&quot;Enable debug messages to system log&quot; checkbox in the
      &quot;Security&quot; tab), then use GDM to the point where it fails, and
      include the GDM output sent to your system log
      (<filename>&lt;var&gt;/log/messages</filename> or
      <filename>&lt;var&gt;/adm/messages</filename> depending on your operating
      system).  Since the system log can be large, please only include the GDM
      debug information and do not sent the entire file.  If you do not see any
      GDM syslog output, you may need to configure syslog (see syslog.3c man
      page).
    </para>

    <para>
      You should not leave debug on after collecting data.  It will clutter your
      syslog and slow system performance.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="wontstart">
      <title>GDM Will Not Start</title>

      <para>
         There are a many problems that can cause GDM to fail to start, but
         this section will discuss a few common problems and how to approach
         tracking down a problem with GDM starting.   Some problems will 
         cause GDM to respond with an error message or dialog when it tries
         to start, but it can be difficult to track down problems when GDM
         fails silently.
      </para>

      <para>
         First make sure that the X server is configured properly.  The 
         GDM configuration file contains a command in the [server-Standard]
         section that is used for starting the X server.  Verify that this
         command works on your system.  Running this command from the 
         console should start the X server.  If it fails, then the problem
         is likely with your X server configuration.  Refer to your X server
         error log for an idea of what the problem may be.  The problem may
         also be that your X server requires different command-line options.
         If so, then modify the X server command in the GDM configuration file
         so that it is correct for your system.
      </para>

      <para>
         Another common problem is that the GDM greeter program is having
         trouble starting.  This can happen, for example, if GDM cannot find
         a needed library or other resource.  Try starting the X server and
         a terminal program, set the shell environment variable 
         DOING_GDM_DEVELOPMENT=1 and run
         <command>&lt;lib&gt;/gdmlogin</command>
         or <command>&lt;lib&gt;/gdmgreeter</command>.  Any error messages
         echoed to the terminal will likely highlight the problem.  Also,
         turning on debug and checking the output sent to the system log 
         will often highlight the problem.
      </para>

      <para>
         Also make sure that the <filename>/tmp</filename> directory has
         reasonable ownership and permissions, and that the machine's file
         system is not full.  These problems will cause GDM to fail to start.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="notaccessfile">
      <title>GDM Will Not Access User Settings</title>

      <para>
         GDM saves user settings, such as your default session and default
         language, in the <filename>~/.dmrc</filename>.  Other files, such
         as the user's <filename>~/.Xauthority</filename> file will also
         affect login.  GDM, by default, is strict about how it tries to
         access files in the user's home directory, and will ignore the file if
         they do not conform to certain rules.  You can use the 
         <filename>RelaxPermissions</filename> configuration option to
         make GDM less strict about how it accesses files in the user's
         home directory, or correct the permissions issues that cause GDM
         to ignore the file.  This is discussed in detail described in the
         &quot;File Access&quot; section of the &quot;Overview&quot;.
