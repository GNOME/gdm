      <para> 
        GDM is a replacement for XDM, the X Display Manager. Unlike its
        competitors (X3DM, KDM, WDM) GDM was written from scratch and does not
        contain any original XDM / X Consortium code. 
      </para>

      <para>
        For further information about GDM, see the

    <sect2 id="daemonov">
      <title>The GDM Daemon</title>
      
      <para> 
        GDM was written with simplicity and security in mind. The overall
        design concept is this: 
      </para>
      
      <para> 
        Upon startup the <filename>gdm</filename> daemon parses its config file
        <filename>gdm.conf</filename>.  For each of the local displays
        <filename>gdm</filename> forks an Xserver and a slave process.  The
        main <filename>gdm</filename> process will then listen to XDMCP
        requests, if so configured, from remote displays and monitor the local
        display sessions.  The main daemon process will also allow starting of
        on new local Xservers on demand using the
        <filename>gdmflexiserver</filename> command.
      </para>
      
      <para> 
        The <filename>gdm</filename> slave process opens the display and starts
        <filename>gdmlogin</filename>, the graphical login program.
        <filename>gdmlogin</filename> runs as a dedicated user and communicates
        asynchronously with the slave process through a pipe.  Alternatively
        <filename>gdmgreeter</filename> command can be used which is the same
        as <filename>gdmlogin</filename> but allows greater themability.
        <filename>gdmgreeter</filename> is referred to as the Themed
        Greeter, while <filename>gdmlogin</filename> is refereed to as the
        GTK+ Greeter.
      </para>
      
      <para> 
        GDM relies heavily on the presence of PAM, Pluggable Authentication
        Modules, but supports regular crypt() and shadow passwords on legacy
        systems.
      </para>

      <para>
        Remote displays can connect to the XDMCP port on the GDM host.
        <filename>gdm</filename> will grant access to hosts specified in the
        gdm service section in your TCP Wrappers configuration file. GDM does
        not support remote display access control on systems without TCP
        Wrappers.  XDMCP support can be turned off completely, however.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM includes several measures making it more resistant to denial of
        service attacks on the XDMCP service. A lot of the protocol parameters,
        handshaking timeouts etc. can be fine tuned. The defaults should work
        for most systems, however.  Don't change them unless you know what
        you are doing.
      </para>

      <para>
        In general GDM is very reluctant regarding reading/writing of user
        files.  For instance it refuses to touch anything but regular files.
        Links, sockets and devices are ignored.  The value of the
        RelaxPermissions parameter determines whether GDM should accept files
        writable by the user's group or others.  These are ignored by default.
      </para>

      <para>
        All operations on user files are done with the effective user id of the
        user.  If the sanity check fails on the user's
        <filename>.Xauthority</filename> file, a fallback cookie is created in
        <filename>/tmp</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that normally it is assumed that the home directory is only
        readable by the user.  However NFS traffic really goes "over the wire"
        and thus can be snooped.  For setups with NFS directories you should
        really use the <filename>UserAuthDir</filename> and set it to some
        local directory such as <filename>/tmp</filename>.  GDM will try to
        open the normal authorization file for reading as root, and if it
        fails, then it will conclude that it is on an NFS mount and it will
        automatically use <filename>UserAuthFBDir</filename>, which is usually
        <filename>/tmp</filename>.  This can be changed by setting
        <filename>NeverPlaceCookiesOnNFS</filename> in the
        <filename>[security]</filename> section to false.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM implements only the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 authorization scheme, see
        the XDMCP section for more information about this, especially relating
        to using X over the network.
      </para>

      <para>
        Finally, the sysadmin can specify the maximum file size GDM should
        accept, and, if the face browser is enabled, a tunable maximum icon
        size is also enforced.  On large systems it is still advised to turn
        off the face browser for performance reasons. Looking up icons in
        homedirs, scaling and rendering face icons can take quite a long time.
        YMMV.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM also has a unix domain socket which can be used to control
        certain aspects of behavior, or to query information about running
        servers or logged in users.  This is the
        <filename>/tmp/.gdm_socket</filename> and the protocol is described
        in the sources in the <filename>daemon/gdm.h</filename> header file.
        The <filename>gdmflexiserver</filename> command uses this for example
        to launch on demand X servers for the user.
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="displaytypes">
      <title>Different Display Types</title>

      <para>
        GDM allows 3 different display types.  First local static X servers.
        These are always run, and when they die or are killed, they are
        restarted.  GDM can run as many of these as needed.  GDM can also
        manage servers on which it does not manage a login itself, thus
        allowing GDM to be used when building X terminals.
      </para>

      <para>
        Next GDM supports flexible or on demand servers.  These are run by
        requesting one using the socket protocol.  There is a command,
        <filename>gdmflexiserver</filename>, which can do this for the user. 
        For standard X servers the user must be logged in from a console, on
        one of the servers that GDM has run.  This command can however also
        launch nested <filename>Xnest</filename> servers which can be started
        even from non-console logins.  This is generally done by running
        <filename>gdmflexiserver -n</filename>.  These servers
        are not restarted when the user session ends.  
        <filename>gdmflexiserver</filename> normally also locks the users
        screen before running a new server with xscreensaver.
      </para>

      <para>
        Last display type is the XDMCP remote displays that are described in
        the next section.  Remote hosts can connect to GDM and present the
        login screen if this is enabled.  Some things may be different for
        these sessions, such as the Actions menu which allows you to shut down,
        reboot, or configure GDM will not be shown.
      </para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="xdmcp">
      <title>
        XDMCP
      </title>

      <para>
        GDM also supports the X Display Manager Protocol (XDMCP) for managing
        remote displays.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM listens to UDP port 177 and will respond to QUERY and
        BROADCAST_QUERY requests by sending a WILLING packet to the originator.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM can also be configured to honor INDIRECT queries and present a
        host chooser to the remote display. GDM will remember the user's
        choice and forward subsequent requests to the chosen manager.  GDM
        also supports an extension to the protocol which will make it forget
        the redirection once the user's connection succeeds.  This extension
        is only supported if both daemons are GDM.  It is transparent and
        will be ignored by XDM or other daemons that implement XDMCP.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM only supports the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 authentication system.
        Normally little is gained from the other schemes, and no effort has
        been made to implement them so far.  Because of this the cookies go
        over the wire as clear text, and thus you should be careful about what
        network you use this on.  That is, you should be careful about through
        where your XDMCP connection is going.  Note that obviously if snooping
        is possible, then the attacker could just snoop your password as you
        log in, so a better XDMCP authentication wouldn't help you much anyway.
        If snooping is possible and undesirable, then you had better use ssh
        for tunneling an X connection anyway rather then using GDM's XDMCP.
        You could think of XDMCP as a sort of graphical telnet, having the
        same security issues.
      </para>

      <para>
        On the upside, GDM's random number generation is very anal and GDM
        goes to extraordinary measures to truly get a 128 bit random number,
        using hardware random number generators if available, plus the current
        time (in microsecond precision), a 20 byte array of pseudorandom
        numbers, process pid's, plus other random information (possibly using
        <filename>/dev/audio</filename> or <filename>/dev/mem</filename> if
        hardware random generators are not available) to create a large buffer
        and then run MD5 digest on this.  Obviously, all this work is wasted if
        you send this cookie over an open network or store it on an NFS
        directory (see <filename>UserAuthDir</filename> configuration key).  So
        be careful about where you use remote X display.
      </para>

      <para>
        Since it is fairly easy to do denial of service attacks on the XDMCP
        service, GDM incorporates a few features to guard against attacks.
        Please read the XDMCP reference section below for more information.
      </para>

      <para>
        Even though GDM tries to outsmart potential attackers, it is still
        advised that you block UDP port 177 on your firewall unless you really
        need it. GDM guards against DoS attacks, but the X protocol is still
        inherently insecure and should only be used in controlled environments.
        Also each remote connection takes up lots of resources, so it is much
        easier to to DoS an XDMCP server then say a webserver.
      </para>

      <para>
        In addition to UDP port 177, you should also block all the X server
        ports (TCP ports 6000 + display number) on the firewall as well.  Do
        note that various places in GDM will use display numbers 20 and higher
        (for example the on demand server stuff).  X is not a very safe
        protocol for leaving on the net, and XDMCP is even less safe.
      </para>

      <para>
        Even though your display is protected by cookies the XEvents and thus
        the keystrokes typed when entering passwords will still go over the
        wire in clear text. It is trivial to capture these.  You should also be
        aware that cookies, if placed on an NFS mounted directory, are prone to
        eavesdropping too.  In case of NFS home directories you should really
        use the <filename>UserAuthDir</filename> and set it to some local
        temporary directory.
      </para>

      <para>
        XDMCP is primarily useful for running thin clients such as in terminal
        labs.  Those thin clients will only ever need the network to access
        the server, and so it seems like the best policy securitywise to have
        those thin clients on a separate network that cannot be accessed by
        the outside world, and can only connect to the server.  The only point
        from which you need to access outside is the server.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="xdmcpaccess">
      <title>
        XDMCP Access Control
      </title>

      <para>
        XDMCP access control is done using TCP wrappers.  It is possible to
        compile GDM without TCP wrappers however, so you should test your
        configuration to see if they work.
      </para>

      <para>
        You should use the daemon name <filename>gdm</filename> in the
        <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename> and
        <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename> files.  For example to 
        deny computers from <filename>.evil.domain</filename> from logging in,
        then add
      </para>
      <screen>gdm: .evil.domain</screen>
      <para>
        to <filename>/etc/hosts.deny</filename>.  You may also need
        to add
      </para>
      <screen>gdm: .your.domain</screen>
      <para>
        to your <filename>/etc/hosts.allow</filename> if you normally disallow
        all services from all hosts.  See the
        <ulink type="help" url="man:hosts.allow">hosts.allow(5)</ulink> man
        page for details.
      </para>

      <para>
        Even though GDM now tries very hard to ignore things coming from
        banned hosts you should not rely on the TCP Wrappers for complete
        protection.  It is really best to block UDP port 177 (and all the X
        ports which are TCP ports 6000 + the display number of course) on your
        firewall.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="stdgreeter">
      <title>The GTK+ Greeter</title>

      <para>
        The GTK+ Greeter is the default graphical user interface that is
        presented to the user. The greeter contains a menu at the top, an
        optional face browser, an optional logo and a text entry
        widget.
      </para>

      <para>
        The text entry field is used for entering logins, passwords,
        passphrases etc. <filename>gdmlogin</filename> is controlled by the
        underlying daemon and is basically stateless. The daemon controls the
        greeter through a simple protocol where it can ask the greeter for a
        text string with echo turned on or off. Similarly, the daemon can
        change the label above the text entry widget to correspond to the
        value the authentication system wants the user to enter.
      </para>

      <para>
        The menu bar in the top of the greeter enables the user to select the
        requested session type/desktop environment, select an appropriate
        locale/language and optionally shutdown/reboot/suspend the machine,
        configure GDM (given the user knows the root password), change
        the GTK+ theme, or start an XDMCP chooser.
      </para>

      <para>
        Optionally the greeter can provide a face browser containing icons for
        all the users on a system. The icons can be installed globally by the
        sysadmin or in the users' home directories.  If installed globally
        they should be in the <filename>&lt;share&gt;/pixmaps/faces/</filename>
        directory (though this can be configured with the
        <filename>GlobalFaceDir</filename>
        configuration option) and the filename should be the name of the user,
        optionally with a <filename>.png</filename> appended.
      </para>

      <para>
        The users can place their icons in a file called
        <filename>~/.face</filename>, and they can use the program
        <filename>gdmphotosetup</filename> to graphically configure this.
      </para>
        
      <para>
        Face icons placed in the global face directory must be readable to
        the gdm user.  However, the daemon, proxies user pictures to the
        greeter and thus those don't have be be readable by the gdm user, but
        root.
      </para>

      <para>
        Please note that loading and scaling face icons located in user home
        directories can be a very time consuming task.  Especially on large
        systems or systems running NIS. The browser feature is only intended
        for systems with relatively few users.  Also if home directories are
        on an on demand mounted filesystem like AFS, then GDM may mount all
        the home directories just to check for pictures if the face browser is
        on.  GDM will try to give up after 5 seconds of activity however and
        only display the users whose pictures it has gotten so far.
      </para>

      <para>
	To control the faces that get displayed, there are a number of 
	configuration options that can be used.  If the
	<filename>Include</filename> option contains a list of users
	separated by commas, then only the specified users will be displayed.
	If the <filename>IncludeAll</filename> option is set to true, then
	the password file will be scanned and all users will be displayed.
	Any user listed in the <filename>Exclude</filename> option and users
	whose UID's is lower than <filename>MinimalUID</filename> will be
	filtered out.
      </para>

      <para>
        When the browser is turned on, valid usernames on the machine are
        inherently exposed to a potential intruder.  This may be a bad idea if
        you don't know who can get to a login screen.  This is especially true
        if you run XDMCP.  However you should never run XDMCP on an open
        network anyway.
      </para>

      <para>
        The greeter can optionally display a logo in the login window.  The
        image must be in a format readable to the gdk-pixbuf library (GIF,
        JPG, PNG, TIFF, XPM and possibly others), and it must be readable to
        the gdm user. See the <filename>Logo</filename> option in the
        reference section below for details.
      </para>

      <title>The Themed Greeter</title>

      <para>
        The Themed Greeter is a greeter interface that takes up the whole

      <para>
        The look and feel of this greeter is really controlled by the theme and
        so the user interface elements that are present may be different.  The
        only thing that must always be present is the text entry field as
        described above in the GTK+ Greeter.

        You can always get a menu of available actions by pressing the F10 key.

      <title>Logging</title>

      <para>
        GDM itself will use syslog to log errors or status.  It can also log
        debugging information, but this is not generally useful unless
        something is very wrong, and this must be enabled in the configuration
        file.
      </para>

      <para>
        Output from the various X servers is stored in the GDM log directory,
        which is configurable, but is usually
        <filename>&lt;var&gt;/log/gdm/</filename>.  The output from the
        session can be found in a file called
        <filename>&lt;display&gt;.log</filename>.  Four older files are also
        stored with <filename>.1</filename> through 
        <filename>.4</filename> appended.  These will be rotated as new
        sessions on that display are started.  You can use these logs to view
        what the X server said when it started up.
      </para>

      <para>
        The output from the user session is redirected to
        <filename>~/.xsession-errors</filename>
        before even the <filename>PreSession</filename> script is started.  So
        it is not really necessary to redirect this again in the session setup
        script.  As is usually done.  If the user session lasted less then
        10 seconds, GDM assumes that the session crashed and allows the user to
        view this file in a dialog before returning to the login screen.
        This way the user can view the session errors from the last session
        and correct the problem this way.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can suppress the 10 second warning by returning code 66 from the
        <filename>Xsession</filename>script or from your session binary (the
        default <filename>Xsession</filename> script propagates those codes
        back).  This is useful if you have some sort of special logins for
        which it is not an error to return less then 10 seconds later, or if
        you setup the session to already display some error message and the
        gdm message would be confusing and redundant.
      </para>

      <para>
        The session output is piped through the GDM daemon and so the
        <filename>~/.xsession-errors</filename> file is capped at about
        200 kilobytes by GDM to prevent a possible denial of service attack
        on the session.  An app could perhaps on reading some wrong data print
        out warnings or errors on the stderr or stdout.  This could perhaps
        fill up the users home directory who would then have to log out and
        log back in to clear this.  This could be especially nasty if quotas
        are set.  GDM also correctly traps the XFSZ signal and stops writing
        the file, which would lead to killed sessions if the file was
        redirected in the old fashioned way from the script.
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that some distributors seem to override the
        <filename>~/.xsession-errors</filename> redirection and do it
        themselves in their own Xsession script (set by the
        <filename>BaseXsession</filename> configuration key) which means that
        GDM will not be able to trap the output and cap this file.  You also
        lose output from the <filename>PreSession</filename> script which can
        make debugging things harder to figure out as perhaps useful output
        of what is wrong will not be printed out.  See the description of the
        <filename>BaseXsession</filename> configuration key for more
        information, especially on how to handle multiple display managers
        using the same script.
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that if the session is a failsafe session, or if GDM can't open
        this file for some reason, then a fallback file will be created in the
        <filename>/tmp</filename> directory named
        <filename>/tmp/xses-&lt;user&gt;.XXXXXX</filename> where the
        <filename>XXXXXX</filename> are some random characters.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you run a system with quotas set, it would be good to delete the
        <filename>~/.xsession-errors</filename> in the
        <filename>PostSession</filename> script.  Such that this log file
        doesn't unnecessarily stay around.

    <sect2 id="gdmuser">
      <title>Security and the GDM User</title>

      <para>
        The GDM daemon normally runs as root, as does the slave.  However GDM
        should also have a dedicated user id and a group id which it uses for
        its graphical interfaces such as <filename>gdmgreeter</filename> and
        <filename>gdmlogin</filename>.  You can choose the name of this user
        and group in the <filename>[daemon]</filename> section of the
        configuration file.
      </para>

      <para>
        The GDM user, and group, which are normally just
        <filename>gdm</filename> should not be user or group of any particular
        privilege.  The reason for using them is to have the user interface
        run as a user without privileges so that in the unlikely case that
        someone finds a weakness in the GUI, they cannot access root on the
        machine.
      </para>

      <para>
        It should however be noted that the GDM user and group have some
        privileges that make them somewhat dangerous.  For one they have
        access to the server authorization directory (the
        <filename>ServAuthDir</filename>), which contains all the X server
        authorization files and other private information.  This means that
        someone who gains the GDM user/group privileges can then connect to
        any session.  So you should not, under any circumstances, make this
        some user/group which may be easy to get access to, such as the
        user <filename>nobody</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The server authorization directory (the
        <filename>ServAuthDir</filename>) is used for a host of random
        internal data in addition to the X server authorization files, and the
        naming is really a relic of history.  GDM daemon enforces this
        directory to be owned by <filename>root.gdm</filename> with the
        permissions of 1770.  This way, only root and the GDM group have write
        access to this directory, but the GDM group cannot remove the root
        owned files from this directory, such as the X server authorization
        files.
      </para>

      <para>
        GDM by default doesn't trust the server authorization directory and
        treats it in the same way as the temporary directory with respect to
        creating files.  This way someone breaking the GDM user cannot mount
        attacks by creating links in this directory.  Similarly the X server
        log directory is treated safely, but that directory should really be
        owned and writable only by root.
      </para>

      <para>
        Anybody found not using a dedicated user for GDM should be whacked over
        the head with a large, blunt, heavy and rusty object, although the
        rusty requirement may be dropped if there is not enough time to have
        the object develop rust.

    <para>
      The configuration files, and especially the <filename>gdm.conf</filename>
      file, contain lots of useful comments, so also read these when
      changing your setup.
    </para>

    <para>
      Some keys in the configuration file as shipped are commented out while
      others are set.  This is done so that defaults can be easily changed in
      the future for some keys.  If you wish to set such a key you must first
      remove the leading hash mark that marks it as a comment.

      The configuration files for GDM are located in the

    <para> 
      <filename>gdm.conf</filename> is the main GDM configuration file. The
      options will be described later in this section.
      <filename>factory-gdm.conf</filename> is the configuration file as
      shipped with the daemon.  This can be useful if you wish to revert to
      the default configuration.
    </para>

    <para> 
      <filename>locale.alias</filename> is a file which looks much like the
      system locale alias but in fact it is not the same.  These are the
      languages that are available on your system.  All the languages are
      still tested to see if they actually exist before presenting them to the

      <filename>XKeepsCrashing</filename> is a script which gets run when the
      X server keeps crashing and we cannot recover.  The shipped default

      configuration program provided the person on the console knows the root
      password.
    </para>

    <para>
      <filename>gdm.conf</filename> is configuration file for both
      <filename>gdm</filename>, <filename>gdmgreeter</filename>,

      since a lot of parameters overlap.

    <para>
      Accessibility modules are configured in the <filename>modules/</filename>
      subdirectory, and are a separate topic.  Read the default files provided,
      they have adequate documentation.  Again normally the default install
      is given in the files with <filename>factory</filename> in their name,
      and those files are not read, they are just there for you so you can
      always revert to default config.
    </para>

    <para>
      The remaining configuration is done by dropping scripts in the
      subdirectories of the <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/</filename> folder or
      dropping <filename>.desktop</filename>-style files in
      <filename>/etc/X11/sessions/</filename>.  The latter is also
      read by KDM for common configuration.  Next the directory
      <filename>&lt;share&gt;/gdm/BuiltInSessions/</filename> is read for
      GDM specific built in sessions (KDM hardcodes these at time of this
      writing).  Also the default setup will also read
      <filename>&lt;share&gt;/xsessions/</filename> (which should be
      <filename>/usr/share/xsessions/</filename> if you really wish to
      cooperate with KDM) where desktop packages can install their session
      files.  The directories under the <filename>/etc</filename> should be
      reserved for configuration.  This approach makes it easy for package
      management systems to install window managers and different session
      types without requiring the sysadmin to edit files.  See the
      <filename>SessionDesktopDir</filename> configuration key for
      changing the paths.  It used to be that GDM stored its built in
      sessions in <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/dm/Sessions/</filename> but this is
      now deprecated as of 2.5.90.0.  Note that prior to version
      2.4.4.2 only the <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/dm/Sessions/</filename> was
      being read.
    </para>

    <para>
      A session can be disabled (if it was installed in
      <filename>/usr/share/xsessions/</filename>) by adding an identically
      named <filename>.desktop</filename> to one of the directories earlier in
      the path (likely <filename>/etc/X11/sessions</filename>) and using
      <filename>Hidden=true</filename> in that file.

        In this section we will explain the <filename>Init</filename>,

      </para>

      <para>
        When the X server has been successfully started, GDM will try to run
        the script called <filename>Init/&lt;displayname&gt;</filename>. I.e.
        <filename>Init/:0</filename> for the first local display.  If this file
        is not found, GDM will attempt to to run
        <filename>Init/&lt;hostname&gt;</filename>. I.e.
        <filename>Init/somehost</filename>.
        If this still is not found, GDM will try
        <filename>Init/XDMCP</filename> for all XDMCP logins or
        <filename>Init/Flexi</filename> for all on demand flexible
        servers.  If none of the above were found, GDM will run
        <filename>Init/Default</filename>. The script will be run as root and
        GDM blocks until it terminates. Use the <filename>Init/*</filename>
        script for programs that are supposed to run alongside with the GDM
        login window. xconsole for instance.  Commands to set the background
        etc. goes in this file too.
      </para>

      <para> 
        It is up to the sysadmin to decide whether clients started by the Init
        script should be killed before starting the user session. This is
        controlled with the <filename>KillInitClients</filename> option in
        <filename>gdm.conf</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
        When the user has been successfully authenticated GDM tries the
        scripts in the <filename>PostLogin</filename> directory in the same
        manner as for the <filename>Init</filename> directory.  This is done
        before any session setup is done, and so this would be the script where
        you might setup the home directory if you need to (though you should
        use the <filename>pam_mount</filename> module if you can for this).
        You have the <filename>$USER</filename> and
        <filename>$DISPLAY</filename> environment variables set for this
        script, and again it is run as root.  The script should return 0 on
        success as otherwise the user won't be logged in.  This is not true for
        failsafe session however.
      </para>

      <para>
        After the user session has been setup from the GDM side of things, GDM
        will run the scripts in the <filename>PreSession</filename> directory,
        again in the same manner as the <filename>Init</filename> directory.
        Use this script for local session management or accounting stuff.  The
        <filename>$USER</filename> environment variable contains the login of
        the authenticated user and <filename>$DISPLAY</filename> is set to the
        current display.  The script should return 0 on success.  Any other
        value will cause GDM to terminate the current login process.  This is
        not true for failsafe sessions however.  Also
        <filename>$X_SERVERS</filename> environmental variable is set and this
        points to a fake generated x servers file for use with the sessreg
        accounting program.
      </para>

      <para>
        After this the base <filename>Xsession</filename> script is run with
        the selected session executable as the first argument.  This is run as
        the user, and really this is the user session.  The available session
        executables are taken from the <filename>Exec=</filename> line in the
        <filename>.desktop</filename> files in the path specified by
        <filename>SessionDesktopDir</filename>.  Usually this path is
        <filename>/etc/X11/sessions/:&lt;etc&gt;/dm/Sessions:/usr/share/xsessions/</filename>.
        The first found file is used.  The user either picks from these
        sessions or GDM will look inside the file <filename>~/.dmrc</filename>
        for the stored preference.
      </para>

      <para>
        This script should really load the users profile and generally do all
        the voodoo that is needed to launch a session.  Since many systems
        reset the language selections done by GDM, GDM will also set the
        <filename>$GDM_LANG</filename> variable to the selected language.  You
        can use this to reset the language environmental variables after you
        run the users profile.  If the user elected to use the system language,
        then <filename>$GDM_LANG</filename> is not set. 
      </para>

      <para> 
        When the user terminates his session, the
        <filename>PostSession</filename> script will be run. Again operation
        is similar to <filename>Init</filename>, <filename>PostLogin</filename>
        and <filename>PreSession</filename>.  Again the script will be run with
        root privileges, the slave daemon will block and the
        <filename>$USER</filename> environment variable will contain the name
        of the user who just logged out and <filename>$DISPLAY</filename> will
        be set to the display the user used, however note that the X server for
        this display may already be dead and so you shouldn't try to access it.
        Also <filename>$X_SERVERS</filename> environmental variable is set and
        this points to a fake generated x servers file for use with the sessreg
        accounting program.
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that the <filename>PostSession</filename> script will be run
        even when the display fails to respond due to an I/O error or
        similar. Thus, there is no guarantee that X applications will work
        during script execution.
      </para>

      <para>
        Except for the <filename>Xsession</filename> script all of these
        scripts will also have the environment variable
        <filename>$RUNNING_UNDER_GDM</filename> set to
        <filename>yes</filename>, so that you could perhaps use similar
        scripts for different display managers.  The
        <filename>Xsession</filename> will always have the
        <filename>$GDMSESSION</filename> set to the basename of the
        session that the user chose to run without the
        <filename>.desktop</filename> extension.  In addition
        <filename>$DESKTOP_SESSION</filename> is also set to the same value
        and in fact this will also be set by KDM in future versions.
      </para>

      <para> 
        Neither of the <filename>Init</filename>,
        <filename>PostLogin</filename>, <filename>PreSession</filename> or
        <filename>PostSession</filename> scripts are necessary and can be left
        out.  The <filename>Xsession</filename> script is however required as
        well as at least one session <filename>.desktop</filename> file.

                AutomaticLoginEnable must be true and this must be

                Alternatively, the name may end with a vertical bar |, the
                pipe symbol.  The name is then used as a program to execute
                which returns the desired username on standard output. If an
                empty or otherwise invalid username is returned, automatic
                login is not performed. This feature is typically used when
                several remote displays are used as internet kiosks, with a
                specific user to automatically login for each display.

                This is the base X session file.  When a user logs in, this
                script will be run with the selected session as the first
                argument.  The selected session will be the
                <filename>Exec=</filename> from the
                <filename>.desktop</filename> file of the session.
              </para>

              <para>
                If you wish to use the same script for several different
                display managers, and wish to have some of the script run only
                for GDM, then you can check the presence of the
                <filename>GDMSESSION</filename> environmental variable.  This
                will always be set to the basename of
                <filename>.desktop</filename> (without the extension) file that
                is being used for this session, and will only be set for GDM
                sessions.  Previously some scripts were checking for
                <filename>GDM_LANG</filename>, but that is only set when the
                user picks a non-system default language.

                This script should take care of doing the "login" for the user
                and so it should source the <filename>/etc/profile</filename>
                and friends.  The standard script shipped with GDM sources
                the files in this order: <filename>/etc/profile</filename>
                then <filename>~/.profile</filename> then
                <filename>/etc/xprofile</filename> and finally
                <filename>~/.xprofile</filename>.  Note that different
                distributions may change this however.  Sometimes users
                personal setup will be in <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename>,
                however broken that is.

                give the user an idea of when they logged in and if it doesn't
                seem kosher to them, they can just abort the login and contact
                the sysadmin (avoids running malicious startup scripts).

              <para>
                The directory where user's <filename>.Xauthority</filename>
                file should be saved.  When nothing is specified the user's
                home directory is used.  This is tilde expanded so you
                can set it to things like: <filename>~/authdir/</filename>.
              </para>

              <para>
                If you do not use the tilde expansion, then the filename
                created will be random, like in
                <filename>UserAuthFBDir</filename>.  This way many users can
                have the same authentication directory.  For example you might
                want to set this to <filename>/tmp</filename> when user has the
                home directory on NFS, since you really don't want cookie files
                to go over the wire.  The users should really have write
                privileges to this directory, and this directory should really
                be sticky and all that, just like the <filename>/tmp</filename>
                directory.
              </para>

              <para>
                Normally if this is the users home directory GDM will still
                refuse to put cookies there if it thinks it is NFS (by testing
                root-squashing).  This can be changed by setting
                <filename>NeverPlaceCookiesOnNFS</filename> in the
                <filename>[security]</filename> section to false.

                By default GDM checks the ownership of the home directories
                before writing to them, this prevents security issues in case
                of bad setup.  However in some instances home directories will

                place cookies into the users home directory if this directory
                is on NFS.  Well, GDM will consider any filesystem with
                root-squashing an NFS filesystem.  Sometimes however the remote
                file system can have root squashing and be safe (perhaps by
                using encryption).  In this case set this to 'false'.  Note

                If this is off, then GDM is in the so called 'switchdesk' mode
                which for example Red Hat uses.  That is, the users can't pick
                the last session and will just then get the default session
                (see <filename>DefaultSession</filename>) unless then pick
                something else for this session only.  So if this is off, this
                really circumvents saving of the last session.

                Note that the actions menu is only shown on local logins as it
                would not be safe or even desirable on remote logins, so you
                don't have to worry about remote users having any sort of

      <title>Per User Configuration</title>

      <para>
        There are some per user configuration settings that control how GDM
        behaves.  Firstly there is the <filename>~/.dmrc</filename> file.  In
        theory this file should be shared between GDM and KDM, so users only
        have to configure things once.  This is a standard
        <filename>.ini</filename> style configuration file.  It has one section
        called <filename>[Desktop]</filename> and can have two keys,
        <filename>Session</filename>, which is the basename of the session
        <filename>.desktop</filename> file that the user wishes to normally use
        (but without the <filename>.desktop</filename> extension)
        and a <filename>Language</filename> key that is the language that the
        user wishes to use.  If either of these keys is missing, the system
        default is used.  The file would normally look as follows:
      </para>

      <screen>
[Desktop]
Session=gnome
Language=cs_CZ.UTF-8

      <para>
        The user can also configure a face image for the face browser.  This is
        done by copying an image into a file called

        GTK+ can read, such as PNG.
      </para>

      <para>
        Face images can also be placed in the global face directory, which is
        normally <filename>&lt;share&gt;/pixmaps/faces/</filename>
        (though this can be configured with the
        <filename>GlobalFaceDir</filename> configuration option) and the

        after all the users have logged out, you can either send the USR1
        signal to the main daemon or run the
        <filename>gdm-safe-restart</filename> command which is in the

        options.  This command will also lock the current screen with
        xscreensaver so that the user can safely walk away from the machine and
        let someone else log in.  XFree86 will automatically switch back to the
        same virtual terminal (if your operating system supports it), after the

        root to use this protocol, and it is mostly used for internal GDM
        chatter.  It is a very simple protocol where you just echo a command on
        a single line to this file.  It can be used to tell GDM things such as
        restart, suspend the machine, or restart all X servers next time it has
        a chance (which would be useful from an X configuration program).

        running and who is logged in on them, and if GDM supports it on your
        operating system, also the virtual terminals of all the console logins.
        You can also request new flexible servers to be run with this protocol,

FLEXI_XNEXT: Start a new flexible Xnest server
Note:        Supported an older version from 2.2.4.0, later
             2.2.4.2, but since 2.3.90.4 you must supply 4
             arguments or ERROR 100 will be returned.  This
             will start Xnest using the XAUTHORITY file
             supplied and as the uid same as the owner of
             that file (and same as you supply).  You must
             also supply the cookie as the third argument
             for this display, to prove that you indeed are
             this user.  Also this file must be readable
             ONLY by this user, that is have a mode of 0600.
             If this all is not met, ERROR 100 is returned.
Note:        The cookie should be the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1,
             the first one gdm can find in the XAUTHORITY
             file for this display.  If that's not what you
             use you should generate one first.  The cookie
             should be in hex form.

      <para>
        The <filename>gdm</filename> command is really just a script which
        runs the <filename>gdm-binary</filename>, passing along any options.
        Before launching gdm-binary, the gdm wrapper script will source the
        <filename>/etc/profile</filename> file to set the standard system
        environment variables.  In order to better support
        internationalization, it will also set the LC_MESSAGES environment
        variable to LANG if neither LC_MESSAGES or LC_ALL are set.  If you
        really need to set some additional environment before launching GDM,
        you can do so in this script.

              first local display and then wait for a GO message in the fifo
              protocol.  No greeter will be shown until the GO message is
              sent.  Also flexiserver requests will be denied and XDMCP will
              not be started until GO is given.  This is useful for
              initialization scripts which wish to start X early, but where
              you don't yet want the user to start logging in.  So the script
              would send the GO to the fifo once it is ready and GDM will
              then continue.  This functionality was added in version 2.5.90.0.

      This section describes the creation of themes for the Themed

      themes and the themes from
      <ulink type="http" url="http://art.gnome.org/themes/gdm_greeter/index.php">

      <title>Theme Overview</title>

      <para>
        GDM Themes can be created by creating an XML file that follows the
        specification in gui/greeter/greeter.dtd.  Theme files are stored
        in the directory
        <filename>&lt;share&gt;/gdm/themes/&lt;theme_name&gt;</filename>.
        Usually this would be under <filename>/usr/share</filename>.  The theme
        directory should contain a file called
        <filename>GdmGreeterTheme.desktop</filename> which has similar format
        to other .desktop files and looks like:
      </para>

      <screen>
[GdmGreeterTheme]
Encoding=UTF-8
Greeter=circles.xml
Name=Circles
Description=Theme with blue circles
Author=Bond, James Bond
Copyright=(c) 2002 Bond, James Bond
Screenshot=screenshot.png
      </screen>

      <para>
        The Name, Description, Author and Copyright fields can be translated
        just like the other <filename>.desktop</filename>files.  All the files
        that are mentioned should be in the theme directory itself.  The
        Screenshot field points to a file which should be a 200x150 screenshot
        of the theme in action (it is OK not to have one, but it makes it nicer
        for user).  The Greeter field points to an XML file that contains the
        description of the theme.  The description will be given later.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once you have theme ready and installed you can test it with the
        installed <filename>gdmthemetester</filename> script.  This script
        assumes that you also have installed the Xnest X server.  It takes two
        arguments, first the environment that should be used.  This is one of
        console, console-timed, flexi, remote-flexi, xdmcp.  Where console is a
        standard console login, console-timed is a console login with a timed
        login going on, flexi is for any local flexible server, remote-flexi is
        for flexi server that is not local (such as an Xnest flexiserver run
        from a remote display) and xdmcp is for remote xdmcp connections.  The
        second argument is the theme name.  So for example to test how things
        look in the xdmcp mode with the circles theme you would run:
      </para>

        <screen>gdmthemetester xdmcp circles</screen>

      <para>
        Be sure to test all the environments with your theme, and make sure to
        test how the caps lock warning looks by pressing caps lock.  This is
        also a good way to take screenshots, just take a screenshot of the
        Xnest window.  This can be done in GNOME by focusing the Xnest window
        and pressing Alt-PrintScreen.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once you have all this done, then make a tarball that contains the
        directory name (so that you could just untar it in the
        <filename>/usr/share/gdm/themes</filename> directory).  And this is the
        tarball you distribute and people can install from the graphical setup
        program.  You can do this with the commands:
      <screen>
cd /usr/share/gdm/themes
tar czvf &lt;theme_name&gt;.tar.gz &lt;theme_name&gt;/

          Box nodes are container nodes for item nodes.  Box nodes are

      <screen>
&lt;box orientation="alignment" min-width="num" xpadding="num"
ypadding="num" spacing="num" homogeneous="bool"&gt;
      </screen>
          Where "num" means number and bool means either "true" or "false".
          The alignment value can be either "horizontal" or "vertical".
          If you leave any property off it will default to zero or "false" in
          case of "homogeneous", and "vertical" for the orientation.
        </para>

        <para>
          If the box is homogeneous then the children are allocated equal
          amount of space.
        </para>

        <para>
          The "min-width" must be specified in pixels.  Obviously there is
          also a corresponding "min-height" property as well.

          Fixed is a container that has its children scattered about
          laid out with precise coordinates.  The size of this container
          is the biggest rectangle that contains all the children.  Fixed
          has no extra properties and so you just use:
          <screen>&lt;fixed&gt;</screen>
          Then you put other items with proper position nodes inside this.

      <sect3 id="positionnodes">
        <title>Position Node</title>

        <para>
          Each item can specify its position and size via the "pos" node.
          For example:
          <screen>&lt;pos x="0" y="4" width="100%" height="100%"/&gt;</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          Both position and size can be given in percent and it will be taken
          as the percentage of the size of the current container.  For toplevel
          items it's the percentage of the whole screen.
        </para>

        <para>
          For x and y, you can also specify a negative position which means
          position from the right or bottom edge.  But this only applies with
          absolute coordinates.  With percentage you can specify negative
          position and it will be still from the same edge.
        </para>

        <para>
          The position also specifies the anchor of the item, this can be
          "n", "ne", "e", "se", "s", "sw", "w" and "nw" or "center" which stand
          for the different edges/corners or "center" for center.  For example:
          <screen>&lt;pos x="10%" y="50%" anchor="w" width="80%" height="95"/&gt;</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          If the item contains a box, you can specify width and height to be
          "box" to mean that they are supposed to be the width and height of
          the box, that is the items in the box plus the padding.
        </para>

        <para>
          If the item contains an SVG image, you can specify width and height
	  to be "scale" to mean that the SVG image should be scaled to fit
	  the requested area.
        </para>

        <para>
          You can also specify an "expand" property to either be "true" or
          false.  If true then the child will be expanded in the box as much
          as possible (that is it will be given more space if available).
        </para>

        <para>
          There are two extra properties you can specify (as of 2.4.4.3) for
          labels (and labels only).  The first is "max-width" which will
          specify the maximum width of the label in pixels.  And the second is
          "max-screen-percent-width" which specifies the maximum percentage of
          the screen width that the label can occupy.  By default no label will
          occupy more then 90% of the screen by width.  An example may be:
          <screen>
&lt;item type="label"&gt;
&lt;pos x="10%" max-screen-percent-width="50%"/&gt;
          </screen>

        <para>
          Some items may only display in certain modes, like when doing a
          remote display.  Multiple values can be specified and must be
          separated with commas.  The following values are possible:
        </para>

        <para>
          <filename>console</filename> - In console mode.
        </para>
        <para>

        <screen>&lt;show modes="flexi,remote"/&gt;</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          You can also specify the "type" value to indicate that certain items
          should only be displayed if the type is true.  Valid values include
          the following:
        </para>

        <para>
          <filename>chooser</filename>, if ChooserButton is set to "true" in

        </para>

        <para>
          For example:

        </para>

        <para>
          Note that if SystemMenu is off then all of halt, reboot, suspend,
          chooser and config will not show, so this is a global toggle for them
          all.  See some of the standard themes for how the show modes
          are used.

        <para>
            When item is "rect" (alpha can be omitted and defaults to 0.0):

        <para>
          When the item type is "pixmap" or "SVG", then the normal, active,

        </para>

        <para>
          Note that relative pathnames are assumed to be in the same

        <para>
          If the item type is of userlist, then the background color for the

        <para>
          Text tags are used by labels.   They can be used to display
          localized text as follows (if the "xml:lang" attribute is
          omitted, the C locale is assumed):
        <screen>&lt;text xml:lang="fr"&gt;Option&lt;/text&gt;</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          You can include pango markup in the text nodes for labels, however
          you must encode it.  So for example to have the label of
          "foo&lt;sup&gt;bar&lt;/sup&gt;", you must type:
        <screen>&lt;text"&gt;foo&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;bar&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&lt;/text&gt;</screen>

        <title>Stock</title>

        <para>
          Certain common localized labels can be specified via the stock
          tags.  The "text" tag is ignored if the "stock" tag is used.   You
          should really use the stock labels rather then just putting all
          the translations into the themes.  This gives faster load times
          and likely better translations.  The following values are valid:

       GDM supports "Accessible Login" to allow users to log in to their
       desktop session even if they cannot easily use the screen, mouse,
       or keyboard in the usual way.  This feature allows the user to launch
       assistive technologies at login time by means of special "gestures"
       from the standard keyboard and from a keyboard, pointing device, or
       switch device attached to the USB or PS/2 mouse port.   It also
       allows the user to change the visual appearance of the login UI
       before logging in, for instance to use a higher-contrast color
       scheme for better visibility.  GDM only supports accessibility with
       the GTK+ Greeter, so the "Greeter" parameter in gdm.conf must be
       set to the GTK+ Greeter "gdmlogin".

             System administrators may wish to load only the minimum subset of
             these modules which is required to support their user base.
             Depending on the end-user needs, not all of the above GtkModules
             may need to be loaded.  If your end-users need the integrated
             Screen Reader and Magnifier, you must include "gail" and
             "atk-bridge".  If your end-users will be using a pointing device
             without buttons or switches, include "dwellmouselistener".  If
             some of your users will use pointing devices with switches,
             alternative physical keyboards, or switch/button devices, include
             "keymouselistener".  Including all four is suitable for most
             system configurations.  The Onscreen Keyboard can operate without
             gail and atk-bridge, but with a reduced feature set; for optimum
             accessibility we recommend including gail and atk-bridge.
             </para>

             <para>
             Once "keymouselistener" and/or "dwellmouselistener" have been
             added to the GtkModules loaded by GDM, you can assign end-user
             actions with the launching of specific assistive technologies.
             These gesture associations are contained in files
             AccessKeyMouseEvents and AccessDwellMouseEvents, respectively.
             The gesture format is described in the two configuration files.
             </para>

             <para>
             The AccessKeyMouseEvents file controls the keymouselistener
             Gesture Listener and is used to define key-press, mouse button,
             or XInput device sequences that can be used to launch programs
             needed for accessibility.  In order to reduce the likelihood of
             unintentional launch, these 'gestures' may be associated with
             multiple switch presses and/or minimum durations.
             </para>

             <para>
             The DwellKeyMouseEvents file controls the dwellmouselistner and
             supports gestures that involve only motion of a pointing device
             such as the system mouse of an alternative pointing device such
             as a head pointer or trackball may also be defined.   All gestures
             are specified by the same syntax; that is, there is no distinction
             between a 'core mouse' gesture and motion from an alternate input
             device.
             </para>

             <para>
             Motion gestures are defined as "crossing events" into and out of
             the login dialog window.  If the 'dwellmouselistener' GtkModule
             is loaded, alternative pointing devices are temporarily "latched"
             to the core pointer, such that motion from alternative devices
             results in movement of the onscreen pointer.
             </para>

             In order to use text-to-speech services at login time (for
             instance, when using the Screen Reader in speech mode) on some

             "audio" group

             By default, gdm requires a media application such as "sox" to be 
             present to play login sounds.  GDM defaults the location of this
             application to <filename>/usr/bin/play</filename> by way of the
             SoundProgram configuration option in <filename>gdm.conf</filename>.
             This value can be changed by modifying the value in the
             <filename>gdm.conf</filename> file.

      <title>Terminal Lab With One Server</title>

      <para>
        Suppose you want to make a lab full of X terminals that all connect
        to one main server.  So let's call one X terminal
        <filename>xterminal</filename> and lets call the server
        <filename>appserver</filename>.  You install GDM on both.
      </para>

      <para>
        On <filename>appserver</filename> you enable XDMCP, so you have
        <screen>
[xdmcp]
Enable=true
        </screen>
        If you want no local screens here, you can then
        make the <filename>[servers]</filename> section empty.
      </para>

      <para>
        On the <filename>xterminal</filename> you disable XDMCP (you don't
        want anyone to connect to the xterminal really).  You will add a
        server type perhaps called <filename>Terminal</filename> as follows:
        <screen>
[server-Terminal]
name=Terminal server
command=/usr/X11R6/bin/X -terminate
flexible=false
handled=false
        </screen>
        This definition should in fact be included in the standard
        configuration file.  Notice that we made the
        <filename>handled</filename> key false since we don't want GDM to
        handle this server localy.  Also note that we have not yet added the
        <filename>-query</filename> argument, you can add that here, or in the
        <filename>[servers]</filename> section.  We'll define our local
        servers as follows:
        <screen>
[servers]
0=Terminal -query appserver
        </screen>
        This will run a direct XDMCP query to the server named
        <filename>appserver</filename>.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="terminallabtwo">
      <title>Terminal Lab With Two Or More Servers</title>

      <para>
        Suppose you want to make a lab full of X terminals that all connect
        to some choice of servers.  For now let's make it
        <filename>appserverone</filename> and
        <filename>appservertwo</filename>.  Again we'll call our example X
        terminal machine <filename>xterminal</filename>.  The setup on both
        servers is the same as with the case of one server in the previous
        section.  You do not need to explicitly enable indirect queries on the
        server since we'll run the choosers locally on the X terminals.
      </para>

      <para>
        So on the <filename>xterminal</filename> you again disable XDMCP.
        You will add a server type perhaps called <filename>Chooser</filename>
        as follows:
        <screen>
[server-Chooser]
name=Chooser server
command=/usr/X11R6/bin/X
flexible=false
chooser=true
        </screen>
        And again this definition should in fact be included in the standard
        configuration file.  Notice that we made the
        <filename>chooser</filename> key true here.  This will run the XDMCP
        chooser for this server, and when the user chooses a host GDM will run
        a query for that host.  Then we'll define our local servers as follows:
        <screen>
[servers]
0=Chooser
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        The XDMCP chooser on the X terminal will normally give a broadcast
        query to see which servers exist on the network.  If the two servers
        are not reachable by a broadcast query, you must add them by hand to
        the configuration file.  So in the <filename>[chooser]</filename>
        section you would have:
        <screen>Hosts=appserverone,appservertwo</screen>
        and any other servers you wish the users to be able to connect to.
      </para>

      <para>
        Sometimes you may want to run the chooser on the server side however.
        Then what you want to do is to run a configuration similar to the
        previous section about the one server configuration with XDMCP
        indirect queries enabled on <filename>appserver</filename> and on the
        X terminals you'd have
        <screen>
[servers]
0=Terminal -indirect appserver
        </screen>
        This way for example you only have to maintain one
        <filename>Hosts</filename> entry.  However as a disadvantage then,
        the <filename>appserver</filename> must then always be available.  So
        it's not good for situations where you want to have serveral servers
        and not all of them have to be on all the time.  You could also have
        one of the X terminals handle indirect XDMCP queries and serve up the
        chooser to the other X terminals.
