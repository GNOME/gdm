"If GDM is failing to work properly, it is always a good idea to include "
"debug information. To enable debugging, set the debug/Enable key to \"true\" "
"in the <filename>&lt;etc&gt;/gdm/custom.conf</filename> file and restart "
"GDM. Then use GDM to the point where it fails, and debug output will be sent "
"to the system log file (<filename>&lt;var&gt;/log/messages</filename> or "
"<filename>&lt;var&gt;/adm/messages</filename> depending on your Operating "
"System). If you share this output with the GDM community via a bug report or "
"email, please only include the GDM related debug information and not the "
"entire file since it can be large. If you do not see any GDM syslog output, "
"you may need to configure syslog (refer to the <ulink type=\"help\" url="

"First make sure that the Xserver is configured properly. The GDM "
"configuration file contains a command in the [server-Standard] section that "
"is used for starting the Xserver. Verify that this command works on your "
"system. Running this command from the console should start the Xserver. If "
"it fails, then the problem is likely with your Xserver configuration. Refer "
"to your Xserver error log for an idea of what the problem may be. The "
"problem may also be that your Xserver requires different command-line "
"options. If so, then modify the Xserver command in the GDM configuration "
